<h2 class="section_title">Network Programming Example: A Networked Game Framework</h2>
<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his section presents</span> several programs that use
networking and threads.  The common problem in each application is to support
network communication between several programs running on different computers.
A typical example of such an application is a networked game with two or
more players, but the same problem can come up in less frivolous applications
as well.  The first part of this section describes a common framework that
can be used for a variety of such applications, and the rest of the section
discusses three specific applications that use that framework.
</p>


<p>This section was inspired by a pair of students, Alexander Kittelberger and
Kieran Koehnlein, who wanted to write a networked poker game as a final project
in a class that I was teaching.  I helped them with the network part of the
project by writing a basic framework to support communication between the players.
Since the application illustrates a variety of important ideas, I decided to
include a somewhat more advanced and general version of that framework in
the current edition of this book.   The final
example is a networked poker game.

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="threads.5.1">12.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Netgame Framework</a>
</h3>


<p>One can imagine playing many different games over the network.  As far as the
network goes, all of those games have at least one thing in common: There has
to be some way for actions taken by one player to be communicated over the
network to other players.  It makes good programming sense to make that
capability available in a reusable common core that can be used in many
different games.  I have written such a core; it is defined by several
classes in the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>.
</p>


<p>We have not done much with packages in this book, aside from using
built-in classes.  Packages were introduced in <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.6.4</a>,
but we have stuck to the ``default package'' in our programming examples.
In practice, however, packages are used in all but the simplest programming
projects to divide the code into groups of related classes.  It makes particularly
good sense to define a reusable framework in a package that can be included as
a unit in a variety of projects.</p>


<p>Integrated development environments such as Eclipse or Netbeans make it very
easy to use packages:  To use the netgame package in a project in an IDE, simply
copy-and-paste the entire <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame">netgame</a></span> directory into the
project.</p>


<p>If you work on the command line, you should be in a working directory
that includes the <i>netgame</i> directory as a subdirectory.  Then, to compile
all the java files in the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>,
for example, you can use the following command in Mac OS or Linux:</p>


<pre>javac netgame/common/*.java</pre>


<p>For windows, you should use backslashes instead of forward slashes:</p>


<pre>javac netgame\common\*.java</pre>


<p>To run a main program that is defined in a package, you should again be in
a directory that contains the package as a subdirectory, and you should use the
full name of the class that you want to run.  For example, the <span class="classname">ChatRoomServer</span>
class, discussed later in this section, is defined in the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/chat/">netgame.chat</a></span>,
so you would run it with the command
</p>


<pre>java netgame.chat.ChatRoomServer</pre>


<p>I will have more to say about packages in the final example of the book,
in <a href="../c13/s5.html">Section&nbsp;13.5</a>.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The applications discussed in this section are examples of distributed
computing, since they involve several computers communicating over a network.
Like the example in <a href="../c12/s4.html#threads.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;12.4.5</a>, they use a central "server,"
or "master," to which a number of "clients" will connect.  All communication
goes through the server; a client cannot send messages directly to another
client.  In this section, I will refer to the server as a <span class="newword">hub</span>,
in the sense of "communications hub":</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="HubAndClients.png" width="391" height="213" alt=""></p>


<p>In <a href="../c12/s4.html#threads.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;12.4.5</a>,
messages were sent back and forth between the server and the client in a definite,
predetermined sequence.  Communication between the server and a client
was actually communication between one thread running on the server and another
thread running on the client.  For the netgame framework, however, I want to 
allow for asynchronous communication, in which it is not possible to wait for
messages to arrive in a predictable sequence.  To make this possible a netgame
client will use two threads for communication, one for sending messages and
one for receiving messages.  Similarly, the netgame hub will use two threads
for communicating with each client.
</p>


<p>The hub is generally connected to many clients and can receive messages
from any of those clients at any time.  The hub will have to process each
message in some way.  To organize this processing, the hub uses a single
thread to process all incoming messages.  When a communication thread
receives a message from a client, it simply drops that message into a
queue of incoming messages.  There is only one such queue, which is 
used for messages from all clients.  The message processing thread runs
in a loop in which it removes a message from the queue, processes it,
removes another message from the queue, processes it, and so on.
The queue itself is implemented as an object of type
<span class="classname">LinkedBlockingQueue</span> (see <a href="../c12/s3.html#threads.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.3.3</a>).</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="HubAndClientThreads.png" width="517" height="251" alt=""></p>


<p>There is one more thread in the hub, not shown in the illustration.  This final
thread creates a <span class="classname">ServerSocket</span> and uses it to listen
for connection requests from clients. Each time it accepts a connection request,
it hands off the client to another object, defined by the nested class 
<span class="classname">ConnectionToClient</span>, which will handle communication with that client.
Each connected client is identified by an ID number.  ID numbers 1, 2, 3,&nbsp;...&nbsp;are
assigned to clients as they connect.  Since clients can also disconnect, the clients
connected at any give time might not have consecutive IDs. A variable
of type <span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;Integer,ConnectionToClient&gt;</span>
associates the ID numbers of connected clients with the objects that
handle their connections.</p>


<p>The messages that are sent and received are objects.  The I/O streams
that are used for reading and writing objects are of type
<span class="classname">ObjectInputStream</span> and <span class="classname">ObjectOutputStream</span>.
(See <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.6">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.6</a>.)  The output stream of a socket is wrapped
in an <span class="classname">ObjectOutputStream</span> to make it possible to transmit
objects through that socket.  The socket's input stream is wrapped in
an <span class="classname">ObjectInputStream</span> to make it possible to receive
objects.  Remember that the objects that are used with such streams
must implement the interface <span class="code">java.io.Serializable</span>.</p>


<p>The netgame <span class="classname">Hub</span> class is defined in the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/Hub.java">Hub.java</a></span>, in the
package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>.
The port on which the server socket will listen must be specified as a 
parameter to the <span class="classname">Hub</span> constructor.
The <span class="classname">Hub</span> class defines a method
</p>


<pre>protected void messageReceived(int playerID, Object message)</pre>


<p>which is called to process messages that are received from clients.
The first parameter, <span class="code">playerID</span>, is the ID number of the client
from whom the message was received, and the second parameter is the message
itself.  In the <span class="classname">Hub</span> class, this method will simply
forward the message to all connected clients.  To forward the message, it
wraps both the <span class="code">playerID</span> and the <span class="code">message</span> in
an object of type <span class="classname">ForwardedMessage</span> (defined in the
file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/ForwardedMessage.java">ForwardedMessage.java</a></span>,
in the package <span class="code">netgame.common</span>).  In a simple application such as
the chat room discussed in the <a href="../c12/s5.html#threads.5.2">next&nbsp;subsection</a>,
this might be sufficient.  For most applications, however, it will be necessary
to define a subclass of <span class="classname">Hub</span> and redefine 
the <span class="code">messageReceived()</span> method to do more complicated message processing.
There are several other methods that a subclass might redefine, including
</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">protected void playerConnected(int playerID)</span>  --  This method is
called each time a player connects to the hub.  The parameter <span class="code">playerID</span>
is the ID number of the newly connected player.  In the <span class="classname">Hub</span>
class, this method does nothing.  Note that the complete list of ID numbers
for currently connected players can be obtained by calling
<span class="code">getPlayerList()</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">protected void playerDisconnected(int playerID)</span>  --  This
is called each time a player disconnects from the hub.  The parameter tells
which player has just disconnected.  In the <span class="classname">Hub</span> class,
this method does nothing.</li>

</ul>


<p>The <span class="classname">Hub</span> class also defines a number of useful public
methods, notably</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">sendToAll(message)</span>  --  sends the specified <span class="code">message</span>
to every client that is currently connected to the hub.  The message must be a non-null
object that implements the <span class="classname">Serializable</span> interface.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">sendToOne(recipientID,message)</span>  --  sends a 
specified <span class="code">message</span> to just one user.  The first parameter,
<span class="code">recipientID</span> is the ID number of the client who will receive the
message.  This method returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value, which is false if
there is no connected client with the specified <span class="code">recipientID</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">shutDownServerSocket()</span>  --  shuts down the hub's
server socket, so that no additional clients will be able to connect.  This could
be used, for example, in a two-person game, after the second client has connected.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">setAutoreset(autoreset)</span>  --  sets the <span class="ptype">boolean</span>
value of the <span class="code">autoreset</span> property.  If this property is <span class="code">true</span>,
then the <span class="classname">ObjectOutputStreams</span> that are used to transmit
messages to clients will automatically be reset before each message is
transmitted.  (Resetting an <span class="classname">ObjectOutputStream</span> is something
that has to be done if an object is written to the stream, modified, and then
written to the stream again.  If the stream is not reset before writing the
modified object, then the old, unmodified value is sent to the stream instead of the new value.
See <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.6">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.6</a> for a discussion of this technicality.)</li>

</ul>


<p>For more information -- and to see how all this is implemented -- you
should read the source code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/Hub.java">Hub.java</a></span>.
With some effort, you should be able to understand everything in that file.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Turning to the client side, the basic netgame client class is defined in the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/Client.java">Client.java</a></span>, in 
the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>.
The <span class="classname">Client</span> class has a constructor that specifies
the host name (or IP address) and port number of the hub to which the client will connect.
This constructor blocks until the connetion has been established.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">Client</span> is an <span class="code">abstract</span> class.
Every netgame application must define a subclass of <span class="classname">Client</span>
and provide a definition for the abstract method:</p>


<pre>abstract protected void messageReceived(Object message);</pre>


<p>This method is called each time a message is received from
the netgame hub to which the client is connected.  A subclass of client
might also override the <span class="code">protected</span> methods
<span class="code">playerConnected</span>, <span class="code">playerDisconnected</span>,
<span class="code">serverShutdown</span>, and <span class="code">connectionClosedByError</span>.
See the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/Client.java">source&nbsp;code</a></span>
for more information.  I should also note that <span class="classname">Client</span>
contains the <span class="code">protected</span> instance variable <span class="code">connectedPlayerIDs</span>,
of type <span class="code">int[]</span>, an array containing the ID numbers of all the clients
that are currently connected to the hub. The most important <span class="code">public</span>
methods that are provided by the <span class="code">Client</span> class are</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">send(message)</span>  --  transmits a message to the hub.  The
<span class="code">message</span> can be any non-null object that implements the
<span class="classname">Serializable</span> interface.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">getID()</span>  --  gets the ID number that was assigned to this client by the hub.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">disconnect()</span>  --  closes the client's connection to the hub.
It is not possible to send messages after disconnecting.  The <span class="code">send()</span>
method will throw an <span class="classname">IllegalStateException</span> is an attempt is
made to do so.</li>

</ul>


<p>The <span class="classname">Hub</span> and <span class="classname">Client</span> classes
are meant to define a general framework that can be used as the basis for
a variety of networked games -- and, indeed, of other distributed programs.
The low level details of network communication and multithreading are hidden
in the <span class="code">private</span> sections of these classes.  Applications that
build on these classes can work in terms of higher-level concepts such
as players and messages.  The design of these classes was developed though several
iterations, based on experience with several actual applications.  I urge
you to look at the source code to see how <span class="classname">Hub</span> and
<span class="classname">Client</span> use threads, sockets, and streams.  In the
remainder of this section, I will discuss three applications built on
the netgame framework.  I will not discuss these applications in great detail.
You can find the complete source code for all three in the
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/">netgame</a></span> package.</p>






<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="threads.5.2">12.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;A Simple Chat Room</a>
</h3>


<p>Our first example is a "chat room," a network application
where users can connect to a server and can then post messages
that will be seen by all current users of the room.  It is similar
to the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/GUIChat.java">GUIChat</a></span> program
from <a href="../c12/s4.html#threads.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;12.4.2</a>, except that any number of 
users can participate in a chat.  While this application is not
a game as such, it does show the basic functionality of the
netgame framework.
</p>


<p>The chat room application consists of two programs.  The first,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/chat/ChatRoomServer.java">ChatRoomServer.java</a></span>,
is a completely trivial program that simply creates a netgame 
<span class="classname">Hub</span> to listen for connection requests
from netgame clients:</p>


<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        new Hub(PORT);
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Can't create listening socket.  Shutting down.");
    }
}</pre>


<p>The port number, <span class="code">PORT</span>, is defined as a constant in the
program and is arbitrary, as long as both the server and the
clients use the same port.</p>


<p>The second part of the chat room application is the program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/chat/ChatRoomWindow.java">ChatRoomWindow.java</a></span>,
which is meant to be run by users who want to participate in the chat room.  
A potential user must know the name (or IP address) of the computer
where the hub is running.  (For testing, it is possible to run 
the client program on the same computer as the hub, using <span class="code">localhost</span>
as the name of the computer where the hub is running.)
When <span class="classname">ChatRoomWindow</span> is
executed, it uses a dialog box to ask the user for this information.  It
then opens a window that will serve as the user's interface to the chat
room.  The window has a large transcript area that displays messages that
users post to the chat room.  It also has a text input box where the
user can enter messages.  When the user enters a message, that message
will be posted to the transcript of every user who is connected to the
hub, so all users see every message sent by every user.  Let's look
at some of the programming.</p>


<p>Any netgame application must define a subclass of the abstract 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/Client.java">Client</a></span> class.
For the chat room application, clients are defined by a nested
class <span class="classname">ChatClient</span> inside <span class="classname">ChatRoomWindow</span>.
The program has an instance variable, <span class="code">connection</span>, of type
<span class="classname">ChatClient</span>, which represents the program's
connection to the hub.  When the user enters a message, that message
is sent to the hub by calling</p>


<pre>connection.send(message);</pre>


<p>When the hub receives the message, it packages it into an object
of type <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/ForwardedMessage.java">ForwardedMessage</a></span>,
along with the ID number of the client who sent the message.  The hub
sends a copy of that <span class="classname">ForwardedMessage</span> to every
connected client, including the client who sent the message.  When
the message is received from the hub by a client object, the
<span class="code">messageReceived()</span> method of the client object is called.
<span class="classname">ChatClient</span> overrides this method to make it
add the message to the transcript of the <span class="classname">ChatClientWindow</span>.
</p>


<p>A client is also notified when a player connects to or disconnects from
the hub and when the connection with the hub is lost.  <span class="classname">ChatClient</span> 
overrides the methods that are called when these events happen so that
they post appropriate messages to the transcript.   Here's the complete definition
of the client class for the chat room application:</p>


<pre>/**
 * A ChatClient connects to a Hub and is used to send messages to
 * and receive messages from the Hub.  Messages received from the
 * Hub will be of type ForwardedMessage and will contain the
 * ID number of the sender and the string that was sent by that user.
 */
private class ChatClient extends Client {

    /**
     * Opens a connection to the chat room server on a specified computer.
     */
    ChatClient(String host) throws IOException {
        super(host, PORT);
    }

    /**
     * Responds when a message is received from the server.  It should be
     * a ForwardedMessage representing something that one of the participants
     * in the chat room is saying.  The message is simply added to the
     * transcript, along with the ID number of the sender.
     */
    protected void messageReceived(Object message) {
        if (message instanceof ForwardedMessage) {  
                         // (no other message types are expected)
            ForwardedMessage fm = (ForwardedMessage)message;
            addToTranscript("#" + fm.senderID + " SAYS:  " + fm.message);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Called when the connection to the client is shut down because of some
     * error message.  (This will happen if the server program is terminated.)
     */
    protected void connectionClosedByError(String message) {
        addToTranscript("Sorry, communication has shut down due to an error:\n     " 
                                        + message);
        sendButton.setEnabled(false);
        messageInput.setEnabled(false);
        messageInput.setEditable(false);
        messageInput.setText("");
        connected = false;
        connection = null;
    }

    /**
     * Posts a message to the transcript when someone leaves the chat room.
     */
    protected void playerConnected(int newPlayerID) {
        addToTranscript("Someone new has joined the chat room, with ID number " 
                                       + newPlayerID);
    }

    /**
     * Posts a message to the transcript when someone leaves the chat room.
     */
    protected void playerDisconnected(int departingPlayerID) {
        addToTranscript("The person with ID number " + departingPlayerID 
                                     + " has left the chat room");
    }

} // end nested class ChatClient</pre>


<p>For the full source code of the chat room application, see the
source code files, which can be found in the package
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/chat">netgame.chat</a></span>.</p>


<p>Note: A user of my chat room application is identified only by an ID number that 
is assigned by the hub when the client connects.  Essentially, users are
anonymous, which is not very satisfying.  See <a href="../c12/ex6-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;12.6</a> 
at the end of this chapter for a way of addressing this issue.</p>







<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="threads.5.3">12.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;A Networked TicTacToe Game</a>
</h3>


<p>My second example is a very simple game: the familiar children's game
TicTacToe.  In TicTacToe, two players alternate placing marks on a
three-by-three board.  One player plays X's; the other plays O's.
The object is to get three X's or three O's in a row.</p>


<p>At a given time, the state of a TicTacToe game consists of
various pieces of information such as the current contents of
the board, whose turn it is, and -- when the game is over -- who
won or lost.  In a typical non-networked version of the game,
this state would be represented by instance variables.  The
program would consult those instance variables to determine
how to draw the board and how to respond to user actions such
as mouse clicks.  In the networked netgame version, however,
there are <b>three</b> programs involved:  Two copies of a 
client program, which provide the interface to the two players
of the game, and the hub program that manages the connections to the
clients.  These programs are not even running on the same 
computer, so they can't share the same instance variables.
Nevertheless, the game has to have a single, well-defined
state at any time, and both players have to be aware of
that state.</p>


<p>My solution is to store the "official" game state in
the hub, and to send a copy of that state to each player
every time the state changes.  The players can't change
the state directly.  When a player takes some action, such
as placing a piece on the board, that action is sent
as a message to the hub.  The hub changes the state to
reflect the result of the action, and it sends the new
state to both players.  The window used by each player will
then be updated to reflect the new state.  In this way, we
can be sure that the game always looks the same to both players.</p>


<p>Networked TicTacToe is defined in several classes in the
package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/tictactoe/">netgame.tictactoe</a></span>.
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/tictactoe/TicTacToeGameState.java">TicTacToeGameState</a></span>
represents the state of a game.  It includes a method
</p>


<pre>public void applyMessage(int senderID, Object message)</pre>


<p>that modifies the state to reflect the effect of a message
received from one of the players of the game.  The message will
represent some action taken by the player, such as clicking
on the board.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">Hub</span> class knows nothing about TicTacToe.
Since the hub for the TicTacToe game has to keep track of the state
of the game, it has to be defined by a subclass of <span class="classname">Hub</span>.
The <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/tictactoe/TicTacToeGameHub.java">TicTacToeGameHub</a></span>
class is quite simple.  It overrides the <span class="code">messageRecieved()</span> method
so that it responds to a message from a player by applying that message
to the game state and sending a copy of the new state to both players.  It
also overrides the <span class="code">playerConnected()</span> and <span class="code">playerDisconnected()</span>
methods to take appropriate actions, since the game can only be played when
there are exactly two connected players.  Here is the complete source code:</p>


<pre>package netgame.tictactoe;

import java.io.IOException;

import netgame.common.Hub;

/**
 * A "Hub" for the network TicTacToe game.  There is only one Hub
 * for a game, and both network players connect to the same Hub.
 * Official information about the state of the game is maintained
 * on the Hub.  When the state changes, the Hub sends the new 
 * state to both players, ensuring that both players see the
 * same state.
 */
public class TicTacToeGameHub extends Hub {
    
    private TicTacToeGameState state;  // Records the state of the game.

<p>A player's interface to the game is represented by the
class <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/tictactoe/TicTacToeWindow.java">TicTacToeWindow</a></span>.
As in the chat room application, this class defines a nested subclass
of <span class="classname">Client</span> to represent the client's connection
to the hub.  One interesting point is how the client responds to a message
from the hub.  Such a message represents a new game state.  When the 
message is received, the window must be updated to show the new state.
The message is received and processed by one thread; the updating is done
in another thread.  This has the potential of introducing race conditions
that require synchronization.  (In particular, as I was developing the
program, I found that it was possible for a message to be received before
the window's constructor had finished executing.  This led to a very
hard-to-diagnose bug because my response to the message was trying to
use objects that had not yet been created.)</p>


<p>When working with the Swing API, it is recommended that all modifications
to the GUI be made in the GUI event thread.  An alternative would be to make
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> and other methods <span class="code">synchronized</span>,
but that would negatively impact the performace of the GUI.  Swing includes
a method <span class="code">SwingUtilitites.invokeLater(runnable)</span>  to make it
possible to run arbitrary code in the GUI event thread.  The parameter,
<span class="code">runnable</span>, is an object that implements the <span class="classname">Runnable</span>
interface that was discussed in <a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.1">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.1</a>.  A
<span class="classname">Runnable</span> object has a <span class="code">run()</span> method.
<span class="code">SwingUtilities.runLater()</span> will schedule the <span class="code">run()</span>
method of the object to be executed in the GUI event thread.  It will be
executed after that thread has finished handling any pending events.
By executing <span class="code">run()</span> in the event thread, you can be sure that
it will not introduce any synchronization problems.  In the TicTacToe
client class, this technique is used in the method that processes
events received from the hub:</p>



<pre>protected void messageReceived(final Object message) {
    if (message instanceof TicTacToeGameState) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){
            public void run() {
                   // The newstate() method updates the GUI for the new state.
                newState( (TicTacToeGameState)message ); 
            }
        });
    }
}</pre>


<p>(The <span class="classname">SwingUtiltites</span> class, by the way, includes a
variety of useful static methods that can be used in programming with Swing;
it's worth taking a look at the documentation for that class.)</p>



<p>To run the TicTacToe netgame, the two players should each run the program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/tictactoe/Main.java">Main.java</a></span>
in the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/tictactoe/">netgame.tictactoe</a></span>.
This program presents the user with a dialog box where the user can 
choose to start a new game or to join an existing game.  If the user
starts a new game, then a <span class="classname">TicTacToeHub</span> is created
to manage the game; a <span class="classname">TicTacToeWindow</span> is created
and connects to that hub.  If the user chooses to connect to an existing
game, then only the window is created; that window connects to the 
hub that was created by the first player.  The second player has to know
the name of the computer where the first player's program is running.
As usual, for testing, you can run everything on one computer and use
"localhost" as the computer name.</p>

<a name="threads.5.4">12.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;A Networked Poker Game</a>
</h3>


<p>And finally, we turn very briefly to the application that inspired the
netgame framework:  Poker.  In particular, I have implemented a
two-player version of the traditional "five card draw" version of
that game.  This is a rather complex application, and I do not
intend to say much about it here other than to describe the general
design.  The full source code can be found in the package
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/fivecarddraw/">netgame.fivecarddraw</a></span>.
To fully understand it, you will need to be familiar with the
game of five card draw poker.  And it uses some techniques
from <a href="../c13/s1.html">Section&nbsp;13.1</a> for drawing the cards.
</p>


<p>In general outline, the Poker game is similar to the TicTacToe game.
There is a <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/fivecarddraw/Main.java">Main</a></span>
class that can be run by either player, to start a new game or to join
an existing game.  There is a class 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/fivecarddraw/PokerGameState.java">PokerGameState</a></span>
to represent the state of a game.  And there is a subclass,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/fivecarddraw/PokerHub.java">PokerHub</a></span>,
of <span class="classname">Hub</span> to manage the game.</p>


<p>But Poker is a much more complicated game than TicTacToe, and the
game state is correspondingly more complicated.  It's not clear that we
want to broadcast a new copy of the complete game state to the players
every time some minor change is made in the state.  Furthermore, it
doesn't really make sense for both players to know the full game state -- that
would include the opponent's hand and full knowledge of the deck from which
the cards are dealt.  (Of course, our client programs wouldn't have to show
the full state to the players, but it would be easy enough for a player to
substitute their own client program to enable cheating.)  So in the Poker
application, the full game state is known only to the <span class="classname">PokerHub</span>.
A <span class="classname">PokerGameState</span> object represents a view of the
game from the point of view of one player only.  When the state of the game
changes, the <span class="classname">PokerHub</span> creates two different
<span class="classname">PokerGameState</span> objects, representing the state of the
game from each player's point of view, and it sends the appropriate game state
objects to each player.  You can see the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/fivecarddraw/">source&nbsp;code</a></span>
for details.</p>


<p>(One of the hard parts in poker is to implement some way to compare
two hands, to see which is higher.  In my game, this is handled by the
class <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/fivecarddraw/PokerRank.java">PokerRank</a></span>.
You might find this class useful in other poker games.)</p>
