<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 12.6</h2>

           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.6:</h3>
<p>The chat room example from <a href="../c12/s5.html#threads.5.2">Subsection&nbsp;12.5.2</a>
can be improved in several ways.  First, it would be nice if the participants
in the chat room could be identified by name instead of by number.
Second, it would be nice if one person could send a private message to
another person that would be seen just by that person rather than by
everyone.   Make these two changes.  You can start with a copy of the
package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/chat/">netgame.chat</a></span>.
You will also need the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>,
which defines the netgame framework.</p>


<p>To make the first change, you will have to implement a subclass of <span class="classname">Hub</span>
that can keep track of client names as well as numbers.  To get the name of a client to
the hub, you can override the <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method both in
the <span class="classname">Hub</span> subclass and in the <span class="classname">Client</span> subclass.
The <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method is called as part of setting up the connection
between the client and the hub.  It is called after the client has been assigned
an ID number but before the connection is considered to be fully connected.  It should
throw an <span class="classname">IOException</span> if some error occurs during the setup process.
Note that messages that are sent by the hub should be read by the client and vice versa.
The <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method in the Client is defined as:
</p>


<pre>protected void extraHandshake(ObjectInputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out) 
                                                    throws IOException</pre>
                                                             

<p>while in the Hub, there is an extra parameter that tells the ID number of
the client whose connection is being set up:</p>


<pre>protected void extraHandshake(in playerID, ObjectInputStream in, 
                              ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException</pre>



<p>In the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/chat/ChatRoomWindow.java">ChatRoomWindow</a></span> class,
the <span class="code">main()</span> routine asks the user for the name of the computer where the
server is running.  You can add some code there to ask the user their name.  You will
have to decide what to do if two users want to use the same name.  You might consider
having a list of users who are allowed to join the chat room.  You might even assign
them passwords.</p>


<p>For the second improvement, personal messages, I suggest
defining a <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> class.  A <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
object would include both the string that represents the message and the
ID numbers of the player to whom the message is being sent and the player who sent the
message.  The hub will have to be programmed to know how to deal with such messages.
A <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> should only be sent to the client who is
listed as the recipient of the message.  You need to decide how the user will
input a private message and how the user will select the recipient of the
message.</p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>My solution defines a subclass, <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>, of
<span class="classname">Hub</span> to make it possible to manage user names.  In
the <span class="classname">Hub</span> class, users are identified by ID numbers.
In some ways, it would have been easier to modify <span class="classname">Hub</span>,
instead of creating a subclass.  However, I wanted to build on the
package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>,
without modifying the existing classes.  The <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>
class has an instance variable</p>


<pre>private TreeMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; nameMap = new TreeMap&lt;Integer,String&gt;();</pre>


<p>to keep track of client names by associating each client's name to that
client's ID number.  That is, <span class="code">nameMap.get(id)</span> is the name of
the client whose ID number is <span class="code">id</span>.  There has to be a way to
add a user name to <span class="code">nameMap</span> when a new client connects,
and there has to be a way to remove a client from <span class="code">nameMap</span>
when that client disconnects.  There also has to be a way for a client
to get a name in the first place.</p>


<p>It might have been nice to have a list of authorized users, and give
each authorized user a name and a password.  The hub would then require a
name and a password before it would let a client connect.  The list of
names and passwords could be stored in a file or, if there are a lot of
them, in a database. That wouldn't have been difficult -- assuming
I used  file.  However, I decided to simply let clients choose their names
when they connect.  The client's selected name is sent to the hub
as part of the <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method.  To avoid having
duplicate names, the hub will modify the client's name if there is
already someone in the chat room using that name.  For example, if the
client wants to be "Fred" and there is already a Fred, then the 
hub will assign the name "Fred#2" to the client.  Since the hub can
modify the name, it sends the client's name back to the client, possibly
with some modification.  The client reads the returned name as part
of the handshake.  So, the <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method in
the client simply sends the client's requested name to the hub by
writing the name to the connection's output stream.  It then reads
the possibly modified name from the connection's input stream:</p>


<pre>protected void extraHandshake(ObjectInputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    try {
        out.writeObject(myName);  // Send user's name request to the server. 
        myName = (String)in.readObject();  // Get the actual, possibly modified, name from the server.
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IOException("Error while setting up connection: " + e);
    }
}</pre>


<p>(This code is from the <span class="classname">ChatClient</span> class, which is a nested
subclass of <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow</span>.)</p>


<p>The corresponding <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method in the <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>
class has to read the name that was sent by the client, possibly modify the name, and write the
name back to the client.  It also adds the client to <span class="code">nameMap</span>, which contains the
names of all connected clients.  My code is very careful to produce a name that is non-null,
non-empty, and unique:</p>


<pre>protected void extraHandshake(int playerID, 
                  ObjectInputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    try {
        String name = (String)in.readObject(); // Read requested name from client.
        if (name == null)
            name = "noname";
        if (name.length() &gt; 15)
            name = name.substring(0,15).trim();
        if (name.equals(""))
            name = "noname";
        synchronized(nameMap) {
               // Synchronized to be absolutely sure that there will be
               // no duplicate names.
            if (nameMap.containsValue(name)) {
                String approvedName = name;
                int num = 2;
                while (nameMap.containsValue(approvedName)) {
                    approvedName = name + "#" + num;
                    num++;
                }
                name = approvedName;
            }
        }
        out.writeObject(name);      // Send actual name to client.
        nameMap.put(playerID,name); // Add client's name to nameMap.
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IOException("Error while setting up connection: " + e);
    }
}</pre>


<hr class="break">


<p>In order to get private messages from one player to another, I defined a
<span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> class, as suggested in the exercise.
An object <span class="code">pm</span> of type <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
has public instance variables <span class="code">pm.senderID</span> and <span class="code">pm.recipientID</span>
to hold the ID numbers of the sender and the recipient, and it has
<span class="code">pm.message</span> to hold the message itself.  The hub has to know what
to do with such a message.  Messages are processed in the hub by the
<span class="code">messageReceived()</span> method.  I overrode this method in
<span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span> to handle <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
and to pass messages of other types on to the superclass.  One interesting
point is that the hub sets the <span class="code">senderID</span> in the message to be
the ID number of the client that actually sent the message.  This is done
to prevent clients from sending forged messages that appear to be from
someone else.  Here is the <span class="code">messageReceived()</span> methog from
<span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>:
</p>


<pre>/**
 * This method is overridden to provide support for PrivateMessages.
 * If a PrivateMessage is received from some client, this method
 * will set the senderID field in the message to be the ID number
 * of the client who sent the message.  It will then send the
 * message on to the specified recipient.  If some other type
 * of message is received, it is handled by the messageReceived()
 * method in the superclass (which will wrap it in a ForwardedMessage
 * and send it to all connected clients).
 */
protected void messageReceived(int playerID, Object message) {
    if (message instanceof PrivateMessage) {
        PrivateMessage pm = (PrivateMessage)message;
        pm.senderID = playerID;
        sendToOne(pm.recipientID, pm);
    }
    else
        super.messageReceived(playerID, message);
}</pre>


<p>It is easy enough to add some extra inputs to the original window
from <span class="classname">ChatRoomWindow</span> to make it possible
for the user to send private messages.  Just add a text input
box for the message, a button to send the message, and
a <span class="classname">JComboBox</span> that contains a list of
possible recipients.  The user enters a message, selects
the recipient from the list, and clicks the button to send.
The program constructs a <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
containing the message and the ID number of the recipient,
and it sends the <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> to
the hub, which forwards it on to the intended recipient.
This code can be found in <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow.</span>
</p>


<p>At least, it <b>would</b> be easy if not for the fact that
I want users of the chat room to be identified by name,
not ID number.  The whole point of using names is that they
provide a more meaningful way to refer to users.  Each client
already gets a list of ID numbers of all connected clients,
but I want each client to have a list of <b>names</b> of
connected clients.  The hub has that information.  I just
needed a way to get that information to the clients.  Since
the client list changes every time a client connects or
disconnects, the hub will have to send new information
to the clients every time that happens.  I was able to
program this behavior by overriding the <span class="code">playerConnected()</span>
and <span class="code">playerDisconnected()</span> methods from
the <span class="classname">Hub</span> class.  My <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>
class includes the following definitions for those methods (which
do nothing in class <span class="classname">Hub</span>):
</p>


<pre>/**
 *  This method is called when a new client connects.  It is called
 *  after the extraHandshake() method has been called, so that the
 *  client's name has already been added to nameMap.  This method
 *  creates a ClientConnectedMessage and sends it to all connected
 *  clients to announce the new participant in the chat room.
 */
protected void playerConnected(int playerID) {
    resetOutput(); // Reset the output stream before resending nameMap.
    sendToAll(new ClientConnectedMessage(playerID,nameMap));
}

/**
 * This method is called when a client has been disconnected from
 * this hub.  It removes the client from the nameMap and sends
 * a ClientDisconnectMessage to all connected players to
 * announce the fact that the client has left the chat room. 
 */
protected void playerDisconnected(int playerID) {
    String name = nameMap.get(playerID); // Get the departing player's name.
    nameMap.remove(playerID);  // Remove the player from nameMap.
    resetOutput(); // Reset the output stream before resending nameMap.
    sendToAll(new ClientDisconnectedMessage(playerID, name, nameMap));
}</pre>


<p>It actually took me quite a while to get this right.  To simplify the
processing, I ended up defining new message types,
<span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessage</span> and
<span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessage</span>, to
hold the information that I wanted to send to the clients.  A
<span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessage</span> includes the
ID number of the client who has just connected, as well as the
<span class="code">nameMap</span> that contains the ID numbers and names
of all connected clients.  When a client receives this message,
it can inform the user that someone has entered the chat
room, and it can use the <span class="code">nameMap</span> to construct
the list of names of possible recipients of private messages.
<span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessages</span> are similar.</p>


<p>Not for the first time, I introduced a bug by forgetting that an
<span class="classname">ObjectOuputStream</span> has to be reset if it is used to send
the same object twice, with modifications between the two transmissions.
This is necessary in this example because the same object, <span class="code">nameMap</span>,
is transmitted as part of every <span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessage</span> and
every <span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessage</span>.  When I didn't
reset the output, the changes that I made to that object was not seen
by the clients that received those messages.  In my code, the
method <span class="code">resetOuput()</span> will cause the output stream leading
to every client to be reset.
</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Back in the <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow</span> class, the chat room
client has to be prepared to receive <span class="classname">PrivateMessages</span>,
<span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessages</span>, and <span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessages</span>.
It can also receive <span class="classname">ForwardedMessages</span> which are used, as in the
original chat room application, to broadcast a message from one client to all
connected clients.  In each case, the client will add an appropriate message to the
transcript.  It uses <span class="code">clientNameMap</span> -- the local copy of <span class="code">nameMap</span> -- to
translate ID numbers from the messages into the names of the corresponding chat room users:
</p>



<pre>protected void messageReceived(Object message) {
    if (message instanceof ForwardedMessage) {
        ForwardedMessage fm = (ForwardedMessage)message;
        String senderName = clientNameMap.get(fm.senderID);
        addToTranscript(senderName + " SAYS:  " + fm.message);
    }
    else if (message instanceof PrivateMessage) {
        PrivateMessage pm = (PrivateMessage)message;
        String senderName = clientNameMap.get(pm.senderID);
        addToTranscript("PRIVATE MESSAGE FROM " + senderName + ":  " + pm.message);
    }
    else if (message instanceof ClientConnectedMessage) {
        ClientConnectedMessage cm = (ClientConnectedMessage)message;
        addToTranscript('"' + cm.nameMap.get(cm.newClientID) + "\" HAS JOINED THE CHAT ROOM.");
        newNameMap(cm.nameMap);
    }
    else if (message instanceof ClientDisconnectedMessage) {
        ClientDisconnectedMessage dm = (ClientDisconnectedMessage)message;
        addToTranscript('"' + clientNameMap.get(dm.departingClientID) + "\" HAS LEFT THE CHAT ROOM.");
        newNameMap(dm.nameMap);
    }
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">newNameMap()</span> method, which is called twice in the above code,
will assign the <span class="code">nameMap</span> from the message to <span class="code">clientNameMap</span>.
It also updates the <span class="classname">JComboBox</span>, <span class="code"></span>, which stores
the list of names of connected users (leaving out the name of the user who is using
the program, since he won't want to send a private message to himself):</p>


<pre>private void newNameMap(final TreeMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; nameMap) {
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            clientNameMap = nameMap;
            clientList.removeAllItems();
            boolean someoneIsThere = false;
            for (String str: nameMap.values()) {
                if (!str.equals(myName)) {
                    clientList.addItem(str);
                    someoneIsThere = true;
                }
            }
            privateMessageInput.setEditable(someoneIsThere);
            privateMessageInput.setEnabled(someoneIsThere);
            sendPrivateButton.setEnabled(someoneIsThere);
            if (!someoneIsThere)
                clientList.addItem("(no one available)");
        }
    });
}</pre>
