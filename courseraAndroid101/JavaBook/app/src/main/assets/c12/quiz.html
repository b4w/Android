<h2 class="quiz_title">Quiz on Chapter 12</h2>
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> questions on Chapter 12 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           You should be able to answer these questions after studying that chapter.
           Sample answers to these questions can be found <a href="quiz_answers.html">here</a>.</p>
<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="8" width="95%">
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</span></td><td>
<p>Write a complete subclass of <span class="classname">Thread</span> to represent
a thread that writes out the numbers from 1 to 10.  Then write some code that
would create and start a thread belonging to that class.</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</span></td><td>
<p>Suppose that <span class="code">thrd</span> is an object of type <span class="classname">Thread</span>.
Explain the difference between calling <span class="code">thrd.start()</span> and calling <span class="code">thrd.run()</span>.</p>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</span></td><td>
<p>What is a <i>race condition</i>?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</span></td><td>
<p>How does synchronization prevent race conditions, and what does it mean to say
that synchronization only provides <i>mutual</i> exclusion?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</span></td><td>
<p>Suppose that a program uses a single thread that takes 4 seconds to run.
Now suppose that the program creates two threads and divides the same work between the
two threads.  What can be said about the expected execution time of the program
that uses two threads?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</span></td><td>
<p>What is an <span class="classname">ArrayBlockingQueue</span>  and how does it
solve the producer/consumer problem?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</span></td><td>
<p>What is a <i>thread pool</i>?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;8:</span></td><td>
<p>Network server programs are
often <i>multithreaded.</i> Explain what this means and why it is true.</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</span></td><td>
<p>Why does a multithreaded network server program often use 
many times more threads than the number of available processors?</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</span></td><td>
<p>Consider the <span class="classname">ThreadSafeCounter</span> example from
<a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.3</a>:</p>

<pre>public class ThreadSafeCounter {
   
   private int count = 0;  // The value of the counter.
   
   synchronized public void increment() {
      count = count + 1;
   }
   
   synchronized public int getValue() {
      return count;
   }
   
}</pre>

<p>The <span class="code">increment()</span> method is synchronized so that the caller of the method can
complete the three steps of the operation "Get value of count," "Add 1 to value,"
"Store new value in count" without being interrupted by another thread. 
But <span class="code">getValue()</span> consists of a single,
simple step.  Why is <span class="code">getValue()</span> synchronized?  (This is a deep and
tricky question.)</p>
