<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 4.6</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.6:</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you will do something even more interesting
with the <span class="classname">Mosaic</span> class that was discussed in <a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>.
(Again, don't forget that you will need <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Mosaic.java">Mosaic.java</a></span> and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>.)
</p>
 

<p>The program that you write for this exercise should start by filling a mosaic with
random colors.  Then repeat the following until the user closes the mosaic window:
Select one of the rectangles in the mosaic at random.  Then select one of the
neighboring rectangles -- above it, below it, to the left of it, or to the right of it.
Copy the color of the originally selected rectangle to the selected neighbor, so that
the two rectangles now have the same color.
</p>
 
 
<p>As this process is repeated over and over, it becomes more and more likely that neighboring
 squares will have the same color.  The result is to build up larger color patches.  On the other
 hand, once the last square of a given color disappears, there is no way for that color to
 ever reappear (extinction is forever!).  If you let the program run long enough, eventually
 the entire mosaic will be one uniform color.</p>
 
 
<p>Here is an applet version of the program.  In the applet version -- but not in the
 version that you will write -- you can double-click the applet to reset all the rectangles 
 to random colors.</p>
 
 
<p align="center">
<applet code="MosaicConvertApplet.java" width="320" height="320" archive="MosaicConvertApplet.jar" alt=""></applet></p>
   
 
<p>After doing each color conversion, your program should insert a very short delay.
 You can try running the program without the delay; it will work, but it might be a little
 glitchy.</p>

<p>I will call the program <span class="classname">Convert</span>, since the basic operation
is to convert one square to be the same color as a neighboring square.  An outline for the
main program is easy:</p>

<pre>Open a mosaic window
Fill the mosaic with random colors
while the window is open:
   Select one of the rectangles at random
   Convert the color of one of that rectangle's neighbors
   Short delay</pre>
   

<p>We have already seen a subroutine for filling the mosaic with random color, in
<a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.6.2">Subsection&nbsp;4.6.2</a>.  I will also write a subroutine to do the second
step in the while loop.  There is some question about what it means to "select one
of the rectangles at random."  A rectangle in the mosaic is specified by a 
row number and a column number.  We can select a random rectangle by choosing a
row number and a column number at random.  Assuming that <span class="code">ROWS</span> and
<span class="code">COLUMNS</span> are constants that give the number of rows and the number of
columns, we can do that by saying</p>


<pre>int randomRow = (int)(ROWS * Math.random());
int randomColumn = (int)(COLUMNS * Math.random());</pre>


<p>where I have declared each variable and initialized it in one step, as
discussed in <a href="../c4/s7.html#subroutines.7.1">Subsection&nbsp;4.7.1</a>.  For the "convert" subroutine
to do its work, we will have to tell it which rectangle has been selected, so
<span class="code">randomRow</span> and <span class="code">randomColumn</span> will be parameters to 
that subroutine.  So, the code for the program's <span class="code">main()</span> routine
becomes:</p>


<pre>Mosaic.open(ROWS, COLUMNS, SQUARE_SIZE, SQUARE_SIZE);
fillWithRandomColors();
while (Mosaic.isOpen()) {
   int randomRow = (int)(ROWS * Math.random());
   int randomColumn = (int)(COLUMNS * Math.random());
   convertRandomNeighbor(randomRow, randomColumn);
   Mosaic.delay(DELAY);
}</pre>


<p>All that remains is to write the <span class="code">convertRandomNeighbor()</span> subroutine.
This routine should pick a random neighbor of a given rectangle and change its color.
A rectangle in the mosaic has four neighbors, above, below, to the left, and to the right.
We can pick one at random by selecting a random integer less than four and using that
integer to decide which neighbor to select.
We have a problem, though, if the rectangle is on the edge of the mosaic.  For example,
if the rectangle is in the top row, then there is no neighbor <b>above</b>
that rectangle in the mosaic.  One solution to this problem is to wrap around to the
bottom of the mosaic and use a square from the bottom row as the neighbor.  Essentially,
we think of the top of the mosaic as connected to the bottom and the left edge as
connected to the right.  We have seen something like this in <a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.6.3">Subsection&nbsp;4.6.3</a>,
in the <span class="code">randomMove()</span> subroutine, and <span class="code">convertRandomNeighbor()</span>
can use some basic ideas from <span class="code">randomMove()</span>.  Here is a version of <span class="code">convertRandomNeighbor()</span>
that would work:
</p>


<pre>static void convertRandomNeighbor(int row, int col) {

   /* Choose a random direction, and get the row and column
    * numbers of the neighbor that lies in that direction. */

   int neighborRow;       // row number of selected neighbor
   int neighborColumn;    // column number of selected neighbor

   int directionNum = (int)(4*Math.random());  // random direction;

   switch (directionNum) {
   case 0:    // Choose neighbor above.
      neighborColumn = col;        // Neighbor is in the same column.
      neighborRow = row - 1;       // Subtract 1 to get neighbor's row number.
      if (neighborRow &lt; 0)         // Neighbor's row number is outside the mosaic.
         neighborRow = ROWS - 1;  // So wrap around to bottom of the mosaic.
      break;
   case 1:    // Choose neighbor to the right.
      neighborRow = row;               // Same row.
      neighborColumn = col + 1;        // Column to the right.
      if (neighborColumn &gt;= COLUMNS)   // Outside the mosaic?
         neighborColumn = 0;          // Wrap around to the left edge
      break; 
   case 2:    // Choose neighbor below.
      neighborColumn = col;
      neighborRow = row + 1;
      if (neighborRow &gt;= ROWS)
         neighborRow = 0;
      break;
   default:    // Choose neighbor to the left.
      neighborRow = row;
      neighborColumn = col - 1;
      if (neighborColumn &lt; 0)
         neighborColumn = COLUMNS - 1;
      break; 
   }
       
   /* Get the color components for position (row,col) */
   
   int red = Mosaic.getRed(row,col);
   int green = Mosaic.getGreen(row,col);
   int blue = Mosaic.getBlue(row,col);
   
    /* Change the color of the neighbor to color of the original square. */
       
    Mosaic.setColor(neighborRow,neighborColumn,red,green,blue);
    
}</pre>


<p>Note the use of a <span class="code">default</span> case at the end of the <span class="code">switch</span>
statement.  Saying "<span class="code">case&nbsp;3</span>" will not work here, because the computer would
not be able to verify that values have definitely been assigned to <span class="code">neighborRow</span>
and <span class="code">neighborColumn</span>.</p>


<p>In my program, I actually used a different algorithm that requires somewhat less code.
My algorithm goes like this:</p>


<pre>Get the color components for the rectangle at position (row,col).
Modify the value of row or col to point to a neighboring rectangle.
Set the color of position (row,col).</pre>


<p>This is a little tricky, since the variables <span class="code">row</span> and <span class="code">col</span> are 
used both for getting the color and for setting it.  But by the time <span class="code">row</span>
and <span class="code">col</span> are used for setting the color, they are referring to a different
rectangle.  You can see my version of <span class="code">convertRandomNeighbor</span> in the full
source code listing below.</p>
