<p>A subroutine is said to have
a <i>contract</i>. What is meant by the contract of a subroutine? When you want
to use a subroutine, why is it important to understand its contract? The
contract has both "syntactic" and "semantic" aspects. What is the syntactic
aspect? What is the semantic aspect?</p>

subroutine. Use a <i>for</i> loop. For example, the command "stars(20)" would
output</p>
