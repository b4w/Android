<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.7:</h3>
<p>This is another <span class="classname">Mosaic</span> exercise,
(using <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Mosaic.java">Mosaic.java</a></span> and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>
as discussed in <a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>).
While the program does not do anything
particularly interesting, it's interesting as a programming problem.  The program
will do the same thing as the following applet:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="MosaicStrobeApplet.java" width="287" height="287" archive="MosaicStrobeApplet.jar" alt=""></applet></p>
   

<p>The program will show a square that grows from the center of the applet to the
edges.  As it grows, the part added around the edges gets brighter, so that in the
end the color of the square fades from white at the edges to dark gray at the center.</p>


<p>The whole picture is made up of the little
rectangles of a mosaic.   You should first write a subroutine that draws the outline of a
rectangle on a <span class="code">Mosaic</span> window.  More specifically, write a subroutine
named <span class="code">outlineRectangle</span> such that the subroutine call statement</p>


<pre>outlineRectangle(top,left,height,width,r,g,b);</pre>


<p>will call <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor(row,col,r,g,b)</span> for each little square
that lies on the outline of a rectangle. The topmost row of the rectangle is
specified by <span class="code">top</span>. The number of rows in the rectangle is specified by
<span class="code">height</span> (so the bottommost row is <span class="code">top+height-1</span>). The leftmost
column of the rectangle is specified by <span class="code">left</span>. The number of columns in
the rectangle is specified by <span class="code">width</span> (so the rightmost column is
<span class="code">left+width-1</span>.)  For the specific program that you are writing,
the width and the height of the rectangle will always be equal, but it's nice
to have the more general-purpose routine.</p>


<p>The animation loops through the same sequence of steps over and over. In each
step, the outline of a rectangle is drawn in gray (that is, with all three color components
having the same value). There is a pause of 200 milliseconds so the user can
see the picture. Then the variables giving the top row, left
column, size, and color level of the rectangle are adjusted to get ready for
the next step. In my applet, the color level starts at 50 and increases by 10
after each step. When the rectangle gets to the outer edge of the applet, the
loop ends, and the picture is erased by filling the mosaic with black.
Then, after a delay of one second, the animation starts again at the beginning of the loop.
You might want to make an additional subroutine to do one loop through
the steps of the basic animation.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">main()</span> routine simply opens a Mosaic window and then does the
animation loop over and over until the user closes the window. There is a 1000
millisecond delay between one animation loop and the next. Use a Mosaic window
that has 41 rows and 41 columns. (I advise you <b>not</b> to use
named constants for the numbers of rows and columns, since the problem is
complicated enough already.)</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>According to the exercise, the first task is to write a subroutine that
draws a rectangle in a Mosaic window. The name and seven parameters of the
subroutine are specified. So the first line of the subroutine definition will
look like this:</p>


<pre>static void outlineRectangle(int left, int top, 
                        int height, int width, int r, int g, int b) {</pre>


<p>The subroutine has to draw the four lines that make up the outline of the
rectangle. Each square that lies along one of these lines will have its color
set by a call to <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor(row,col,r,g,b)</span>. We just have to make
sure that <span class="code">row</span> and <span class="code">col</span> take on all the correct values that are
needed to hit all the necessary squares. For the topmost line of the rectangle,
for example, <span class="code">row</span> is given by the value of the parameter, <span class="code">top</span>.
And, as the exercise explains, the value of <span class="code">col</span> varies from
<span class="code">left</span> to <span class="code">left+width-1</span>. So the topmost line of the rectangle
can be drawn with the <span class="code">for</span> loop:</p>


<pre>for ( col = left;  col &lt;= left+width-1;  col++ )
    Mosaic.setColor(top,col,r,g,b);</pre>


<p>The bottommost row can be drawn by a similar <span class="code">for</span> loop, except that
the value of <span class="code">row</span> along the bottommost row is <span class="code">top+height-1</span>, as
noted in the exercise. We can combine the two <span class="code">for</span> loops to draw the
top and bottom lines at the same time:</p>


<pre>for ( col = left;  col &lt;= left+width-1;  col++ ) {
    Mosaic.setColor(top,col,r,g,b);           // A square on the top line.
    Mosaic.setColor(top+height-1,col,r,g,b);  // A square on the bottom line.
}</pre>


<p>Drawing the leftmost and rightmost lines of the rectangle is similar. The
row number along these lines varies from <span class="code">top</span> to <span class="code">top+height-1</span>.
The column number of the leftmost line is given by <span class="code">left</span>, and the
column number of the rightmost line is <span class="code">left+width-1</span>. So, these two
lines can be drawn with the <span class="code">for</span> loop:</p>


<pre>for ( row = top;  row &lt;= top+height-1;  row++ ) {
    Mosaic.setColor(row,left,r,g,b);           // A square on the left line.
    Mosaic.setColor(row,left+width-1,r,g,b);   // A square on the right line.
}</pre>


<p>When I wrote my program, I used the test "<span class="code">row &lt; top+height</span>" in
the first <span class="code">for</span> loop in place of "<span class="code">row &lt;= top+height-1</span>", and
similarly for the second loop. The meaning is the same, and the form that I
used would probably be preferred by most Java and C++ programmers. Putting this
all together gives the <span class="code">outlineRectangle()</span> subroutine:</p>


<pre>static void outlineRectangle(int top, int left, 
                        int height, int width, int r, int g, int b) {
   int row, col;
   for ( row = top;  row &lt; top + height;  row++ ) {
      Mosaic.setColor(row, left, r, g, b);
      Mosaic.setColor(row, left + width - 1, r, g, b);
   }
   for ( col = left;  col &lt; left + width; col++ ) {
      Mosaic.setColor(top, col, r, g, b);
      Mosaic.setColor(top + height - 1, col, r, g, b);
   }
}  // end rectangle()</pre>


<p>We still have the problem of designing the complete program. The
<span class="code">main()</span> routine plays the same animation over and over as long as the
window is still open. A pseudocode algorithm for this is given by</p>


<pre>Open a mosaic window
while the window remains open:
    Delay for 1000 milliseconds
    Play once through the animation</pre>


<p>I will write a subroutine named <span class="code">strobe</span> that  gradually fills in the
big square. After that subroutine has finished, I want to erase the picture by filling
the mosaic with black.  You could do that with a nested <span class="code">for</span> loop that sets
the color of every rectangle in the Mosaic individually.  However, the <span class="classname">Mosaic</span>
class already includes a subroutine <span class="code">Mosaic.fill(r,g,b)</span> that does exactly that.
Using the <span class="code">fill</span> subroutine, we can call <span class="code">Mosaic.fill(0,0,0)</span> to fill
the entire mosaic with black.  So, the body of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
becomes:</p>


<pre>Mosaic.open(41,41,5,5);
while ( Mosaic.isOpen() ) {
    Mosaic.delay(1000);
    strobe();
    Mosaic.fill(0,0,0);
}</pre>


<p>The final stage in the design is to write the <span class="code">strobe()</span> routine. The
outline of an algorithm is already given in the exercise. It can be written
more formally as</p>


<pre>Initialize variables top,left,size,brightness for the first step
Repeat until the rectangle is as big as the whole window:
    Draw the rectangle outline in gray
    Delay 200 milliseconds
    Update the variables for the next step</pre>


<p>The window has 41 columns and 41 rows of squares. We want the rectangle to
start at the middle of the window. That will be in row 20 and column 20, so we
can initialize <span class="code">top</span> and <span class="code">left</span> to 20. The rectangle starts off
as small as possible, that is with <span class="code">rectSize</span> equal to 1. The value
of <span class="code">rectSize</span>is used as both the width and the height of the rectangle. The
<span class="code">brightness</span> is initialized to 50. The value of <span class="code">brightness</span> is
used for each of the color components, <span class="code">r</span>, <span class="code">g</span>, and <span class="code">b</span>.
So, the rectangle can be drawn in gray with the subroutine call statement:</p>


<pre>outlineRectangle(top,left,rectSize,rectSize,brightness,brightness,brightness);</pre>



<p>As for updating the variables to get ready for the next iteration of the loop,
<span class="code">brightness</span> increases by 10 at each step. The topmost line of the rectangle moves up one row. This means
that the value of <span class="code">top</span> decreases by&nbsp;1. Similarly, the value of
<span class="code">left</span> decreases by&nbsp;1. The rectangle grows by one row on
<b>each</b> side, so its <span class="code">size</span> increases by&nbsp;2.</p>


<p>There are
several ways to check whether the animation should continue. We could check
whether its <span class="code">size</span> is &lt;= 41. Or whether <span class="code">left</span> is &gt;= 0. Or
whether <span class="code">top</span> is &gt;= 0. Alternatively, we could notice that there are
21 steps in the animation, and we could just use a <span class="code">for</span> loop to count
from 1 to 21. Picking one of these methods more or less at random, the
algorithm for the <span class="code">strobe()</span> becomes</p>


<pre>left = 20
top = 20
size = 1
brightness = 50
while left is &gt;= 0:
    draw the rectangle outline
    delay 200 milliseconds
    left -= 1
    top -= 1
    size += 2
    brightness += 10</pre>


<p>This translates easily into Java code. One more note: In my implementation
of the subroutine, I changed the condition in the loop to "<span class="code">while (left
&gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; Mosaic.isOpen())</span>", since there is no reason to continue
with the animation if the user has closed the window. However, the program will
work without this extra test. It just might take an extra second or so for the
program to end after the user closes the window.</p>
