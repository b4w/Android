<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>ntroduction to Programming Using Java</span> is a free
introductory computer programming textbook that uses Java as the language of
instruction.  It is suitable for use in an introductory programming course
and for people who are trying to learn programming on their own. There are
no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the ideas of computers and
programs.  There is enough material for a full year of college-level
programming.  Chapters 1 through 7 can be used as a textbook in a one-semester
college-level course or in a year-long high school course.  The remaining
chapters can be covered in a second course.</p>


<p>The Sixth Edition of the book covers "Java&nbsp;5.0", along with a few features
that were interoducted in Java&nbsp;6 and Java&nbsp;7.  While Java&nbsp;5.0
introduced major new features that need to be covered in an introductory programming
course, Java&nbsp;6 and Java&nbsp;7 did not.  Whenever the text covers a feature that
was not present in Java 5.0, that fact is explicitly noted. 
Note that Java applets appear throughout the pages of 
this book.  Most of the applets require Java&nbsp;5.0 or higher.</p>

<p>In style, this is a textbook rather than a tutorial. That is, it
concentrates on explaining concepts rather than giving step-by-step
how-to-do-it guides.
I have tried to use a conversational writing style that
might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. You'll find
programming exercises at the end of each chapter, except for Chapter&nbsp;1.
For each exercise, there is a web page that gives a detailed
solution for that exercise, with the sort of discussion that I would give if I
presented the solution in class. I <b>strongly</b> advise that you read the
exercise solutions if you want to get the most out of this book.</p>


<p>This is
certainly not a Java reference book, and it is not a
comprehensive survey of all the features of Java. It is <b>not</b> written as
a quick introduction to Java for people who already know another programming
language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are learning
programming for the first time, and it is as much about general programming
concepts as it is about Java in particular. I believe that <i>Introduction to
Programming using Java</i> is fully competitive with the conventionally
published, printed programming textbooks that are available on the market.
(Well, all right, I'll confess that I think it's better.)</p>


<p>There are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses
graphical user interface programming from the very beginning. Some people
believe that object oriented programming should also be emphasized from the
very beginning. This is <b>not</b> the approach that I take. The approach that I favor
starts with the more basic building blocks of programming and builds from
there. After an introductory chapter,
I cover procedural programming in Chapters 2, 3, and&nbsp;4.
Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapter&nbsp;5. Chapter&nbsp;6
covers the closely related topic of event-oriented programming and
graphical user interfaces. Arrays are covered in Chapter&nbsp;7.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is a short chapter that marks a turning point in the book, moving beyond the
fundamental ideas of programming to cover more advanced topics.
Chapter&nbsp;8 is about writing robust, correct, and efficient programs.
Chapters&nbsp;9 and 10 cover recursion and data structures, including the Java Collection
Framework.  Chapter&nbsp;11 is about files and networking.  Chapter&nbsp;12
covers threads and parallel processing.  Finally,
Chapter&nbsp;13 returns to the topic of graphical user interface programming
to cover some of Java's more advanced capabilities.</p>

<p>Major changes were made for the <b>previous</b> (fifth) edition of this book.  Perhaps the most
significant change was the use of parameterized types in the chapter
on generic programming.  Parameterized types -- Java's version
of templates -- were the most eagerly anticipated new feature in
Java&nbsp;5.0. Other new features in Java 5.0 were also introduced in the fifth edition,
including enumerated types, formatted output, the
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> class, and variable arity methods.
In addition, Javadoc comments were covered for the first time.</p>


<p>The changes in this <b>sixth</b> edition are much smaller.  The major change is a
new chapter on threads (<a href="../c12/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>).  Material about threads from the previous edition has
been moved to this chapter, and a good deal of new material has been added.
Other changes include some coverage of features added to Java in versions 6 and&nbsp;7
and the inclusion of a glossary. There are also smaller changes throughout the
book.</p>

<b>A technical note on production:</b> The on-line and PDF versions of this
book are created from a single source, which is written largely in XML. 
To produce the
PDF version, the XML is processed into a form that can be used by the TeX
typesetting program.  In addition to
XML files, the source includes DTDs, XSLT transformations, Java source code files,
image files, a TeX macro file, and a couple of scripts that are used in processing.

<b>I have made the complete source files available for download at

</p>


<p>These files were not originally meant for publication, and therefore are not very
cleanly written.  Furthermore, it requires a fair amount of expertise to use them
effectively.  However, I have had several requests for the sources and have made
them available on an "as-is" basis.  For more information about the source and
how they are used see the <a href="README-full-source.txt">README file</a> from
the source download.</p>
