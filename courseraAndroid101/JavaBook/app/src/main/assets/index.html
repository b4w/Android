<big>W</big>ELCOME TO 
         the Sixth Edition of <i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i>,
         a free, on-line textbook on introductory
         programming, which uses Java as the language of instruction.  This book is directed
         mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for experienced
         programmers who want to learn something about Java.  It is certainly not meant to
         provide complete coverage of the Java language.
        </p>
<p>The sixth edition requires Java 5.0 and can also be used with later versions of java.
        Almost all the examples in the book will work with Java 5.0, but some features from later
        versions of Java are also covered.  You will find many Java applets
         on the web pages that make up this book, and most of those applets require
         Java&nbsp;5.0 or higher to function.  Earlier editions of the book are still available; 
         see the <a href="preface.html">preface</a> for links.
         </p>
<p>You can <b>download</b>&nbsp;<i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i> for use on your
         own computer.  A PDF version is also available.
