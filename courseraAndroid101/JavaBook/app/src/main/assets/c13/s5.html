<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>n this final section</span>, I will present a program
that is more complex and more polished than those we have looked at previously.
Most of the examples in this book have been "toy" programs that illustrated
one or two points about programming techniques.  It's time to put it all
together into a full-scale program that uses many of the techniques that
we have covered, and a few more besides.  After discussing the program and
its basic design, I'll use it as an excuse to talk briefly about some of
the features of Java that didn't fit into the rest of this book.</p>
   

<p>The program that we will look at is a Mandelbrot Viewer that lets the user
explore the famous Mandelbrot set.  I will begin by explaining what that means.
If you have downloaded the web version of this book, note that the jar file
<span class="code"><a href="MandelbrotViewer.jar">MandelbrotViewer.jar</a></span> 
is an executable jar file that you can use to run the program as a stand-alone application.  
The jar file is in the directory <span class="code">c13</span>, which contains all the files for this chapter.

To see the program in action, click on this button, which will open a separate Mandelbrot
Viewer window:</p>
   


<p align="center">

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.5.1">13.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mandelbrot Set</a>
</h3>


<p>The Mandelbrot set is a set of points in the xy-plane that is defined by a computational
procedure.  To use the program, all you really need to know is that the Mandelbrot
set can be used to make some pretty pictures, but here are the mathematical details:
Consider the point that has real-number coordinates <span class="code">(a,b)</span> and
apply the following computation:</p>


<pre>Let x = a
Let y = b
Repeat:
   Let newX = x*x - y*y + a
   Let newY = 2*x*y + b
   Let x = newX
   Let y = newY</pre>
   

<p>As the loop is repeated, the point <span class="code">(x,y)</span> changes.  The question is,
does <span class="code">(x,y)</span> grow without bound or is it trapped forever in a finite region
of the plane?  If <span class="code">(x,y)</span> escapes to infinity (that is, grows without bound), 
then the starting point <span class="code">(a,b)</span> is <b>not</b> in the Mandelbrot set.  If 
<span class="code">(x,y)</span> is trapped in a finite region, then <span class="code">(a,b)</span> is in the 
Mandelbrot set. Now, it is known that if <span class="code">x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>2</sup></span>
ever becomes strictly greater than&nbsp;4, then <span class="code">(x,y)</span> will escape to infinity.
If <span class="code">x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>2</sup></span> ever becomes bigger than 4 in the
above loop, we can end the loop and say that <span class="code">(a,b)</span> is definitely not in the Mandelbrot
set.  For a point <span class="code">(a,b)</span> in the Mandelbrot set, the loop will never end.
When we do this on a computer, of course, we don't want to have a loop that runs
forever, so we put a limit on the number of times that the loop is executed:</p>
   

<pre>x = a;
y = b;
count = 0;
while ( x*x + y*y &lt; 4.1 ) {
   count++;
   if (count &gt; maxIterations)
      break;
   double newX = x*x - y*y + a;
   double newY = 2*x*y + b;
   x = newY;
   y = newY;
}</pre>


<p>After this loop ends, if <span class="code">count</span> is less than or equal to <span class="code">maxIterations</span>,
we can say that <span class="code">(a,b)</span> is not in the Mandelbrot set.  If <span class="code">count</span> is
greater than <span class="code">maxIterations</span>, then <span class="code">(a,b)</span> might or might not be
in the Mandelbrot set, but the larger <span class="code">maxIterations</span> is, the more likely that
<span class="code">(a,b)</span> is actually in the set.</p> 
   

<p>To make a picture from this procedure, use a rectangular grid of pixels to represent
some rectangle in the plane.  Each pixel corresponds to some real number coordinates
<span class="code">(a,b)</span>.  (Use the coordinates of the center of the pixel.)  Run the above
loop for each pixel.  If the <span class="code">count</span> goes past <span class="code">maxIterations</span>,
color the pixel black; this is a point that is possibly in the Mandelbrot set.  Otherwise,
base the color of the pixel on the value of <span class="code">count</span> after the loop ends,
using different colors for different counts.  In some sense, the higher the count, the
closer the point is to the Mandelbrot set, so the colors give some information about
points outside the set and about the shape of the set.  However, it's important to
understand that the colors are arbitrary and that colored points are <b>not</b>
in the set.  Here is a picture that was produced by the Mandelbrot Viewer program
using this computation.  The black region is the Mandelbrot set:</p>
        

<p align="center">
<img src="mandelbrot.png" width="253" height="200" alt="The Mandelbrot Set"></p>


<p>When you use the program, you can "zoom in" on small regions of the plane.  To do so,
just drag the mouse on the picture.  This will draw a rectangle around part of the picture.
When you release the mouse, the part of the picture inside the rectangle will be zoomed
to fill the entire display.  If you simply click a point in the picture, you will zoom
in on the point where you click by a magnification factor of two.  (Shift-click or
use the right mouse button to zoom out instead of zooming in.)  The interesting points
are along the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  In fact, the boundary is infinitely
complex.  (Note that if you zoom in too far, you will exceed the capabilities of
the <span class="ptype">double</span> data type; nothing is done in the program to prevent this.)</p>
   

<p>Use the "MaxIterations" menu to increase
the maximum number of iterations in the loop.  Remember that black pixels might or might
not be in the set; when you increase "MaxIterations," you might find that a black region
becomes filled with color.  The "Palette" menu determines the set of colors that are
used.  Different palettes give very different visualizations of the set.  The
"PaletteLength" menu determines how many different colors are used.  In the default
setting, a different color is used for each possible value of <span class="code">count</span> in
the algorithm.  Sometimes, you can get a much better picture by using a different
number of colors.  If the palette length is less than <span class="code">maxIterations</span>,
the palette is repeated to cover all the possible values of <span class="code">count</span>;
if the palette length is greater than <span class="code">maxIterations</span>, only part of
of the palette will be used.  (If the picture is of an almost uniform color, try
<i>decreasing</i> the palette length, since that makes the color vary more quickly
as <span class="code">count</span> changes.  If you see what look like randomly colored dots
instead of bands of color, try <i>increasing</i> the palette length.)</p>
   

<p>If you run the Mandelbrot Viewer program as a stand-alone application, it will
have a "File" menu that can be used to save the picture as a PNG image file.  You
can also save a "param" file which simply saves the settings that produced the current
picture.  A param file can be read back into the program using the "Open" command.</p>
   

<p>The Mandelbrot set is named after Benoit Mandelbrot, who was the first person
to note the incredible complexity of the set.  It is astonishing that such complexity
and beauty can arise out of such a simple algorithm.</p>

<a name="GUI2.5.2">13.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Design of the Program</a>
</h3>


<p>Most classes in Java are defined in packages.  While we have used
standard packages such as <span class="code">javax.swing</span> and <span class="code">java.io</span>
extensively, almost all of my programming examples have been in the
"default package," which means that they are not declared to belong
to any named package.  However, when doing more serious programming, 
it is good style to create a package to hold the classes for your
program.  The Oracle corporation recommends that package names should be
based on an Internet domain name of the organization that produces
the package.  My office computer has domain name <span class="code">eck.hws.edu</span>,
and no other computer in the world should have the same name.
According to Oracle, this allows me to use the package name
<span class="code">edu.hws.eck</span>, with the elements of the domain name
in reverse order.  I can also use sub-packages of this package,
such as <span class="code">edu.hws.eck.mdb</span>, which is the package name
that I decided to use for my Mandelbrot Viewer application.
No one else -- or at least no one else who uses the same naming
convention -- will ever use the same package name, so this
package name uniquely identifies my program.</p>


<p>I briefly discussed using packages in <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.6.4</a>
and in the context of the programming examples in <a href="../c12/s5.html">Section&nbsp;12.5</a>
Here's what you need to know for the Mandelbrot Viewer program:
The program is defined in ten Java source code files.  They can be
found in the directory <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb">edu/hws/eck/mdb</a></span> inside
the <span class="code">source</span> directory of the web site.  (That is, they
are in a directory named <span class="code">mdb</span>, which is inside a
directory named <span class="code">eck</span>, which is inside <span class="code">hws</span>,
which is inside <span class="code">edu</span>.  The directory structure must follow
the package name in this way.)  The same directory also contains a
file named <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/strings.properties">strings.properties</a></span>
that is used by the program and that will be discussed below.
For an Integrated Development Environment
such as Eclipse, you should just have to add the <span class="code">edu</span> directory
to your project.  To compile the files on the command line, you must be
working in the directory that contains the <span class="code">edu</span> directory.
Use the command</p>
   

<pre>javac  edu/hws/eck/mdb/*.java</pre>
   

<p>or, if you use Windows,</p>
   

<pre>javac  edu\hws\eck\mdb\*.java</pre>
   

<p>to compile the source code.  The main routine for the stand-alone application version
of the program is defined by a class named <span class="classname">Main</span>.  To run this
class, use the command:</p>
   

<pre>java  edu.hws.eck.mdb.Main</pre>
   

<p>This command must also be given in the directory that contains the <span class="code">edu</span> directory.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>The work of computing and displaying images of the Mandelbrot set is done
in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/MandelbrotDisplay.java">MandelbrotDisplay.java</a></span>.  The
<span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> class is a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.
It uses an off-screen canvas to hold a copy of the image.  (See <a href="../c13/s1.html#GUI2.1.1">Subsection&nbsp;13.1.1</a>.)
The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method copies this image onto the panel.  Then, if the user
is drawing a "zoom box" with the mouse, the zoom box is drawn on top of the image.
In addition to the image, the class uses a two-dimensional array to store the
iteration count for each pixel in the image.
If the range of xy-values changes, or if the size of the window changes, all the
counts must be recomputed.  Since the computation can take quite a while,
it would not be acceptable to block the user interface while the computation is
being performed.  The solution is to do the computation in separate "worker" threads,
as discussed in <a href="../c12/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>.  The program uses one worker thread
for each available processor.  When the computation begins, the image is filled
with gray.  Every so often, about twice a second, the data that has been computed by
the computation threads is gathered and applied to the off-screen canvas, and the part
of the canvas that has been modified is copied to the screen.  A <span class="classname">Timer</span>
is used to control this process -- each time the timer fires, the image is updated with any
new data that has been computed by the threads.  The user can continue
to use the menus and even the mouse while the image is being computed.</p>
   

<p>The file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/MandelbrotPanel.java">MandelbrotPanel.java</a></span> defines the
main panel of the Mandelbrot Viewer window.  <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>
is another subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.  A <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>
is mostly filled with a <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>.  It also adds
a <span class="classname">JLabel</span> beneath the display.  The <span class="classname">JLabel</span>
is used as a "status bar" that shows some information that might be interesting to
the user.  The <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> also defines the program's
mouse listener.  In addition to handling zooming, the mouse listener puts the
x and y coordinates of the current mouse location in the status bar as the user
moves or drags the mouse.  Also, when the mouse exits the drawing area, the text
in the status bar is set to read "Idle".  This is the first time that we have seen
an actual use for <span class="code">mouseMoved</span> and <span class="code">mouseExited</span> events.
(See <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.2</a> and <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>.)</p>
   

<p>The menu bar for the program is defined in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/Menus.java">Menus.java</a></span>.
Commands in the "File" and "Control" menu are defined as <span class="classname">Actions</span>.
(See <a href="../c13/s3.html#GUI2.3.1">Subsection&nbsp;13.3.1</a>.)  Note that among the actions are file manipulation
commands that use techniques from <a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.3">Subsection&nbsp;11.2.3</a>, <a href="../c11/s5.html#IO.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;11.5.3</a>,
and <a href="../c13/s1.html#GUI2.1.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.1.5</a>.  The "MaxIterations," "Palette," and "PaletteLength"
menus each contain a group of <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItems</span>.
(See <a href="../c13/s3.html#GUI2.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;13.3.3</a>.)  I have tried several approaches for handling such
groups, and none of them have satisfied me completely.  In this program, I have
defined a nested class inside <span class="classname">Menus</span> to represent each group.
For example, the <span class="classname">PaletteManager</span> class contains the
menu items in the "Palette" menu as instance variables.  It registers an action
listener with each item, and it defines a few utility routines for operating on
the menu.  The classes for the three menus are very similar and should probably
have been defined as subclasses of some more general class.</p>
   

<p>One interesting point is that the contents of the menu bar are different,
depending on whether the program is being run as an applet or as a stand-alone
application.  Since applets cannot access the file system, there is no "File"
menu for an applet.  Furthermore, accelerator keys are generally not functional
in an applet that is running on a web page, so accelerator keys are only added
to menu items if the program is being run in its own window.  (See <a href="../c13/s3.html#GUI2.3.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.3.5</a>
for information on accelerators.)  To accomplish this, the constructor in the
<span class="classname">Menus</span> class has parameters that tell it whether the
menu bar will be used by an applet and whether it will be used in a frame;
these parameters are consulted as the menu bar is being built.</p>


<p>A third parameter to the constructor is the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> that
is being used in the program.  Many of the menu commands operate on this panel
or on the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> that it contains.  In order to
carry out these commands, the <span class="classname">Menus</span> object needs a reference
to the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>.  As for the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>,
the panel has a method <span class="code">getDisplay()</span> that returns a reference to
the display that it contains. So as long as the menu bar has a reference to the
panel, it can obtain a reference to the display.  In previous examples, everything
was written as one large class file, so all the objects were directly available to
all the code.  When a program is made up of multiple interacting files,
getting access to the necessary objects can be more of a problem.</p>
   

<p>
<span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>, <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>,
and <span class="classname">Menus</span> are the main classes that make up the
Mandelbrot Viewer program.  <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/MandelbrotFrame.java">MandelbrotFrame.java</a></span>
defines a simple subclass of <span class="classname">JFrame</span> that runs the
program in its own window.  <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/MandelbrotApplet.java">MandelbrotApplet.java</a></span>
defines an applet that runs the program on a web page. (This applet version has an extra "Examples" menu
that is discussed in the source code file.)  There are a few other classes that I will discuss below.</p>
   

<p>This brief discussion of the design of the Mandelbrot Viewer has shown that it
uses a wide variety of techniques that were covered earlier in this book.
In the rest of this section, we'll look at a few new features of Java
that were used in the program.</p>
   
   
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.5.3">13.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationalization</a>
</h3>
   

<p>
<span class="newword">Internationalization</span> refers to writing a program that
is easy to adapt for running in different parts of the world.  Internationalization
is often referred to as <span class="newword">I18n</span>, where 18 is the number of letters
between the "I" and the final "n" in "Internationalization."  The process of adapting
the program to a particular location is called <span class="newword">localization</span>,
and the locations are called <span class="newword">locales</span>.  Locales differ in many
ways, including the type of currency used and the format used for numbers and
dates, but the most obvious difference is language.  Here, I will discuss how
to write a program so that it can be easily translated into other languages.</p>
   

<p>The key idea is that strings that will be presented to the user should
not be coded into the program source code.  If they were, then a translator
would have to search through the entire source code, replacing every string
with its translation.  Then the program would have to be recompiled.  In
a properly internationalized program, all the strings are stored together
in one or more files that are separate from the source code, where they
can easily be found and translated.  And since the source code doesn't have
to be modified to do the translation, no recompilation is necessary.</p>
   

<p>To implement this idea, the strings are stored in one or more <span class="newword">properties files</span>.
A properties file is just a list of key/value pairs.  For translation purposes, the
values are strings that will be presented to the user; these are the strings that
have to be translated.  The keys are also strings, but they don't have to be translated
because they will never be presented to the user.  Since they won't have to be modified,
the key strings can be used in the program source code.  Each key uniquely identifies
one of the value strings.  The program can use the key string to look up the corresponding
value string from the properties file.  The program only needs to know the key string;
the user will only see the value string.  When the properties file is translated,
the user of the program will see different value strings.</p>
   

<p>The format of a properties file is very simple.  The key/value pairs take the form</p>


<pre>key.string=value string</pre>
   

<p>There are no spaces in the key string or before the equals sign.  The value string
can contain spaces or any other characters.  If the line ends with a backslash ("<span class="code">\</span>"),
the value string is continued on the next line; in this case, spaces at the beginning
of that line are ignored.  One unfortunate detail is that a properties file can contain
only plain ASCII characters.  The ASCII character set only supports the English alphabet.  Nevertheless,
a value string can include arbitrary UNICODE characters.  Non-ASCII characters just have
to be specially encoded.  The JDK comes with a program, <i>native2ascii</i>,
that can convert files that use non-ASCII characters into a form that is suitable
for use as a properties file.</p>
   

<p>Suppose that the program wants to present a string to the user 
(as the name of a menu command, for example).   The properties file would contain a key/value pair
such as</p>
   

<pre>menu.saveimage=Save PNG Image...</pre>
   

<p>where "Save PNG Image..." is the string that will appear in the menu.  The
program would use the key string, "menu.saveimage", to look up the corresponding value string
and would then use the value string as the text of the menu item.  In Java, the look
up process is supported by the <span class="classname">ResourceBundle</span> class, which
knows how to retrieve and use properties files.  Sometimes a string that is presented
to the user contains substrings that are not known until the time when the program is
running.  A typical example is the name of a file.  Suppose, for example, that
the program wants to tell the user, "Sorry, the file, <i>filename</i>, cannot be loaded",
where <i>filename</i> is the name of a file that was selected by the user at run time.
To handle cases like this, value strings in properties files can include placeholders
that will be replaced by strings to be determined by the program at run time.  The
placeholders take the form "<span class="code">{0}</span>", "<span class="code">{1}</span>", "<span class="code">{2}</span>",&nbsp;....
For the file error example, the properties file might contain:</p>
   

<pre>error.cantLoad=Sorry, the file, {0}, cannot be loaded</pre>
   

<p>The program would fetch the value string for the key <span class="code">error.cantLoad</span>.  It would
then substitute the actual file name for the placeholder, "<span class="code">{0}</span>".  Note that when
the string is translated, the word order might be completely different.  By using a placeholder for
the file name, you can be sure that the file name will be put in the correct grammatical
position for the language that is being used.  Placeholder substitution is not handled
by the <span class="classname">ResourceBundle</span> class, but Java has another class,
<span class="classname">MessageFormat</span>, that makes such substitutions easy.</p>
   

<p>For the Mandelbrot Viewer program, the properties file is 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/strings.properties">strings.properties</a></span>.  (Any properties
file should have a name that ends in "<span class="code">.properties</span>".)  Any string that you see when
you run the program comes from this file.  For handling value string lookup, I wrote
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/I18n.java">I18n.java</a></span>.  The <span class="classname">I18n</span>
class has a static method</p>
   

<pre>public static tr( String key, Object... args )</pre>
   

<p>that handles the whole process.  Here, <span class="code">key</span> is the key string
that will be looked up in <span class="code">strings.properties</span>.  Additional parameters, if any,
will be substituted for placeholders in the value string.  (Recall that the
formal parameter declaration "<span class="code">Object...</span>" means that there can be any
number of actual parameters after <span class="code">key</span>; see <a href="../c7/s2.html#arrays.2.6">Subsection&nbsp;7.2.6</a>.)
Typical uses would include:</p>
   

<pre>String saveImageCommandText = I18n.tr( "menu.saveimage" );
   
String errMess = I18n.tr( "error.cantLoad" , selectedFile.getName() );</pre>
   

<p>You will see function calls like this throughout the Mandelbrot Viewer source code.
The <span class="classname">I18n</span> class is written in a general way so that it can be
used in any program.  As long as you provide a properties file as a resource,
the only things you need to do are change the resource file name in <span class="code">I18n.java</span>
and put the class in your own package.</p>
   

<p>It is actually possible to provide several alternative properties files in the
same program.  For example, you might include French and Japanese versions of the
properties file along with an English version.  If the English properties file is named
<span class="code">strings.properties</span>, then the names for the French and Japanese versions
should be <span class="code">strings_fr.properties</span> and <span class="code">strings_ja.properties</span>.
Every language has a two-letter code, such as "fr" and "ja", that is used in constructing
properties file names for that language.  The program asks for the properties file
using the simple name "<span class="code">strings</span>".  If the program is being run on a
Java system in which the preferred language is French, the program will try to
load "<span class="code">strings_fr.properties</span>"; if that fails, it will look for
"<span class="code">strings.properties</span>".  This means that the program will use the
French properties files in a French locale; it will use the Japanese properties file in a
Japanese locale; and in any other locale it will use the default properties file.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.5.4">13.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Events, Events, Events</a>
</h3>
   

<p>We have worked extensively with mouse events, key events, and action events, but
these are only a few of the event types that are used in Java.  The Mandelbrot Viewer
program makes use of several other types of events.  It also serves as an example of
the benefits of event-oriented programming.</p>
   

<p>Let's start from the following fact:  The <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>
class knows nothing about any of the other classes that make up the program (with the
single exception of one call to the internationalization method <span class="code">I18n.tr</span>).
Yet other classes are aware of things that are going on in the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>
class.  For example, when the size of the display is changed, the new size is reported
in the status bar that is part of the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> class.
In the <span class="classname">Menus</span> class, certain menus are disabled when the
display begins the computation of an image and are re-enabled when the computation
completes.  The display doesn't call methods in the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>
or <span class="classname">Menus</span> classes, so how do these classes get their information
about what is going on in the display?  The answer, of course, is events.  The
<span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> object emits events of various types when various
things happen.  The <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> and <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>
objects set up listeners that hear those events and respond to them.</p>
   

<p>The point is that because events are used for communication, the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>
class is not strongly coupled to the other classes.  In fact, it can be used in other
programs without any modification and without access to the other classes.  The alternative to using events would be
to have the display object call methods such as <span class="code">displaySizeChanged()</span>
or <span class="code">computationStarted()</span> in the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> and 
<span class="classname">MandelbrotFrame</span> objects to tell them what is going on in the display.
This would be strong coupling: Any programmer who wanted to use <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>
would also have to use the other two classes or would have to modify the display class so
that it no longer refers to the other classes.  Of course, not everything can be done with 
events and not all strong coupling is bad: The <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> class
refers directly to the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> class and cannot be used
without it -- but since the whole purpose of a <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>
is to hold a <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span>, the coupling is not a problem.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>The Mandelbrot Viewer program responds to mouse events on the display.  These
events are generated by the display object, but the display class itself doesn't care
about mouse events and doesn't do anything in response to them.  Mouse events are handled
by a listener in the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span>, which responds to them by
zooming the display and by showing mouse coordinates in the status bar.</p>
   

<p>The status bar also shows the new size of the display whenever that size is changed.
To handle this, events of type <span class="classname">ComponentEvent</span> are used.
When the size of a component is changed, a <span class="classname">ComponentEvent</span>
is generated.  In the Mandelbrot Viewer program, a <span class="classname">ComponentListener</span>
in the <span class="classname">MandelbrotPanel</span> class listens for size-change events
in the display.  When one occurs, the listener responds by showing the new size in the
status bar; the display knows nothing about the status bar that shows the display's size.</p>


<p>Component events are also used internally in the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> 
class in an interesting way.  When the user dynamically changes the size of the display,
its size can change several times each second.  Normally, a change of display size
would trigger the creation of a new off-screen canvas and the start of a new
asynchronous computation of the image.  However, doing this is
a big deal, not something I want to do several times in a second.  If you try resizing
the program's window, you'll notice that the image doesn't change size dynamically
as the window size changes.  The same image and off-screen canvas are used as long as
the size is changing.  Only about one-third of a second after the size has stopped
changing will a new, resized image be produced.  Here is how this works:
The display sets up a <span class="classname">ComponentEvent</span> to listen for
resize events on itself.  When a resize occurs, the listener starts a <span class="classname">Timer</span>
that has a delay of 1/3 second.  (See <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.5.1</a>.)
While this timer is running, the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method does not resize the image; instead, it reuses the image that already exists.
If the timer fires 1/3 second later, the image will be resized at that time. However, if
another resize event occurs while the first timer is running, then the first timer will
be stopped before it has a chance to fire, and a new timer will be started with a
delay of 1/3 second.  The result is that the image does not get resized until 1/3
second after the size of the window stops changing.</p>
   

<p>The Mandelbrot Viewer program also uses events of type <span class="classname">WindowEvent</span>,
which are generated by a window when it opens or closes (among other things). One
example is in the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/LauncherApplet.java">LauncherApplet.java</a></span>.
This file defines an applet that appears as a button on the web page.  The button
is labeled "Launch Mandelbrot Viewer".  When the user clicks the button, a
<span class="classname">MandelbrotFrame</span> is opened on the screen, and the text on the
button changes to "Close Mandelbrot Viewer".  When the frame closes, the button changes
back to "Launch Mandelbrot Viewer", and the button can be used to open another window.  The frame
can be closed by clicking the button, but it can also be closed using a "Close" command
in the frame's menu bar or by clicking the close box in the frame's title bar.  The
question is, how does the button's text get changed when the frame is closed by one
of the latter two methods?  One possibility would be to have the frame call a method
in the applet to tell the applet that it is closing, but that would tightly couple the frame class to
the applet class.  In fact, it's done with <span class="classname">WindowEvents</span>.
A <span class="classname">WindowListener</span> in the applet listens for close events
from the frame.  In response to a close event, the text of the button is changed.
Again, this can happen even though the frame class knows nothing about the applet class.
Window events are also used by <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/Main.java">Main.java</a></span>
to trigger an action that has to be taken when the program is ending; this will be discussed
below.</p>


<p>Perhaps the most interesting use of events in the Mandelbrot Viewer program is to
enable and disable menu commands based on the status of the display.  For this,
events of type <span class="classname">PropertyChangeEvent</span> are used.  This event
class is part of the "bean" framework that was discussed briefly in <a href="../c11/s5.html#IO.5.2">Subsection&nbsp;11.5.2</a>,
and class <span class="classname">PropertyChangeEvent</span> and related classes are
defined in the package <span class="code">java.beans</span>.  The idea is that bean objects are
defined by their "properties" (which are just aspects of the state of the bean).
When a bean property changes, the bean can emit a <span class="classname">PropertyChangeEvent</span>
to notify other objects of the change.  Properties for which property change
events are emitted are known technically as <span class="newword">bound properties</span>.
A bound property has a <b>name</b> that identifies that particular property 
among all the properties of the bean.  When a property change event is generated,
the event object includes the name of the property that has changed, the previous
value of the property, and the new value of the property.</p>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> class has a bound property whose
name is given by the constant <span class="code">MandelbrotDisplay.STATUS_PROPERTY</span>.
A display emits a property change event when its status changes.
The possible values of the status property are given by other constants, such as
<span class="code">MandelbrotDisplay.STATUS_READY</span>.  The <span class="code">READY</span> status
indicates that the display is not currently running a computation and is ready
to do another one.  There are several menu commands that should be enabled only when the status
of the display is <span class="code">READY</span>.  To implement this, the <span class="classname">Menus</span>
class defines a <span class="classname">PropertyChangeListener</span> to listen
for property change events from the display.  When this listener hears an
event, it responds by enabling or disabling menu commands according to the
new value of the status property.</p>
   

<p>All of Java's GUI components are beans and are capable of emitting property change
events.  In any subclass of <span class="classname">Component</span>, this can be done simply by calling
the method</p>
   

<pre>public void firePropertyChange(String propertyName, 
                                           Object oldValue, Object newValue)</pre>


<p>For example, the <span class="classname">MandelbrotDisplay</span> class uses the following
method for setting its current status:</p>
   

<pre>private void setStatus(String status) {
   if (status == this.status) {
           // Note: Event should be fired only if status actually changes.
      return;
   }
   String oldStatus = this.status;
   this.status = status;
   firePropertyChange(STATUS_PROPERTY, oldStatus, status);
}</pre>
   

<p>When writing bean classes from scratch, you have to add support for
property change events, if you need them.  To make this easier, the <span class="code">java.beans</span> package
provides the <span class="classname">PropertyChangeSupport</span> class.</p>

<a name="GUI2.5.5">13.5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom Dialogs</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Java has several standard dialog boxes that are defined in the classes
<span class="classname">JOptionPane</span>, <span class="classname">JColorChooser</span>,
and <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span>.  These were introduced in
<a href="../c6/s8.html#GUI1.8.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.8.2</a> and <a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.3">Subsection&nbsp;11.2.3</a>.  Dialogs of
all these types are used in the Mandelbrot Viewer program.  However, sometimes
other types of dialog are needed.  In such cases, you can build a custom
dialog box.</p>
   

<p>Dialog boxes are defined by subclasses of the class <span class="classname">JDialog</span>.
Like frames, dialog boxes are separate windows on the screen, and the <span class="classname">JDialog</span>
class is very similar to the <span class="classname">JFrame</span> class.  The big difference is
that a dialog box has a <span class="newword">parent</span>, which is a frame or another dialog
box that "owns" the dialog box.   If the parent of a dialog box closes, the dialog box
closes automatically.  Furthermore, the dialog box will probably "float" on top of
its parent, even when its parent is the active window.</p>
   

<p>Dialog boxes can be either <span class="newword">modal</span> or <span class="newword">modeless</span>.
When a modal dialog is put up on the screen, the rest of the application is blocked
until the dialog box is dismissed.  This is the most common case, and all the standard
dialog boxes are modal.  Modeless dialog boxes are more like independent windows,
since they can stay on the screen while the user interacts with other windows.
There are no modeless dialogs in the Mandelbrot Viewer program.</p>
   

<p>The Mandelbrot Viewer program uses two custom dialog boxes.  They are used to
implement the "Set Image Size" and "Set Limits" commands and are defined by the
files <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/SetImageSizeDialog.java">SetImageSizeDialog.java</a></span>
and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/SetLimitsDialog.java">SetLimitsDialog.java</a></span>.
The "set image size" dialog lets the user enter a new width and height for the Mandelbrot image.
The "set limits" dialog lets the user input the minimum and maximum values for x and y
that are shown in the image.  The two dialog classes are very similar.  In both classes,
several <span class="classname">JTextFields</span> are used for user input.  Two buttons named
"OK" and "Cancel" are added to the window, and listeners are set up for these buttons.
If the user clicks "OK", the listener checks whether the inputs in the text fields
are legal; if not, an error message is displayed to the user and the dialog stays
on the screen.  If the input is legal when the user clicks "OK", the dialog is disposed.
The dialog is also disposed if the user clicks "Cancel" or clicks the dialog box's
close box.  The net effect is that the dialog box stays on the screen until the
user either cancels the dialog or enters legal values for the inputs and clicks "OK".
The program can find out which of these occurred by calling a method named
<span class="code">getInput()</span> in the dialog object after showing the dialog.  This method returns <span class="code">null</span>
if the dialog was canceled; otherwise it returns the user input.</p>
   

<p>To make my custom dialog boxes easy to use, I added a <span class="code">static</span>
<span class="code">showDialog()</span> method to each dialog class.  When this function is called,
it shows the dialog, waits for it to be dismissed, and then returns the value
of the <span class="code">getInput()</span> method.  This makes it possible to use my
custom dialog boxes in much the same way as Java's standard dialog boxes are
used.</p>
   

<p>Custom dialog boxes are not difficult to create and to use, if you already
know about frames.  I will not discuss them further here, but you can look
at the source code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/SetImageSizeDialog.java">SetImageSizeDialog.java</a></span>
as a model.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.5.6">13.5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferences</a>
</h3>

<p>Most serious programs allow the user to set <span class="newword">preferences</span>.
A preference is really just a piece of the program's state that is saved between
runs of the program.  In order to make preferences persistent from one run of
the program to the next, the preferences could simply be saved to a file in the user's
home directory.  However, there would then be the problem of locating the file.
There would be the problem of naming the file in a way that avoids conflicts with
file names used by other programs.  And there would be the problem of cluttering up
the user's home directory with files that the user shouldn't even have to know 
about.</p>
   

<p>To deal with these problems, Java has a standard means of handling
preferences.  It is defined by the package <span class="code">java.util.prefs</span>.
In general, the only thing that you need from this package is the class
named <span class="classname">Preferences</span>.</p>


<p>In the Mandelbrot Viewer program, the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/Main.java">Main.java</a></span>
has an example of using <span class="classname">Preferences</span>.  <span class="code">Main.java</span> runs
the stand-alone application version of the program, and its use of preferences applies only
when the program is run in that way.</p>
   

<p>In most programs, the user sets preferences in a custom dialog box. However,
the Mandelbrot program doesn't have any preferences that are appropriate for that
type of treatment.  Instead, as an example, I automatically save a few aspects of the
program's state as preferences.  Every time the program starts up, it reads the
preferences, if any are available.  Every time the program terminates, it saves
the preferences.  (Saving the preferences poses an interesting problem because
the program ends when the <span class="classname">MandelbrotFrame</span> window closes,
not when the <span class="code">main()</span> routine ends.  In fact, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
ends as soon as the window appears on the screen.  So, it won't work to save
the preferences at the end of the main program.  The solution is to use events:
A listener listens for <span class="classname">WindowEvents</span> from the frame.  When
a window-closed event is received, indicating that the program is ending,
the listener saves the preferences.)</p>
   

<p>Preferences for Java programs are stored in some platform-dependent form in some
platform-dependent location.  As a Java programmer, you don't have to worry about it;
the Java preferences system knows where to store the data.  There is still the problem
of identifying the preferences for one program among all the possible Java programs
that might be running on a computer.  Java solves this problem in the same way
that it solves the package naming problem.  In fact, by convention, the preferences
for a program are identified by the package name of the program, with a slight
change in notation.  For example, the Mandelbrot Viewer program is defined in the
package <span class="code">edu.hws.eck.mdb</span>, and its preferences are identified
by the string "/edu/hws/eck/mdb".  (The periods have been changed to "<span class="code">/</span>",
and an extra "<span class="code">/</span>" has been added at the beginning.)</p>
   

<p>The preferences for a program are stored in something called a "node."  The user
preferences node for a given program identifier can be accessed as follows:</p>
   

<pre>Preferences root = Preferences.userRoot();
Preferences node = root.node(pathName);</pre>
   

<p>where <span class="code">pathname</span> is the string, such as "/edu/hws/eck/mdb", that
identifies the node.  The node itself consists of a simple list of
key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are strings.  You can
store any strings you want in preferences nodes -- they are really just
a way of storing some persistent data between program runs.  In general, though,
the key string identifies some particular preference item, and the associated
value string is the value of that preference.  A <span class="classname">Preferences</span> object,
<span class="code">prefnode</span>, contains methods <span class="code">prefnode.get(key)</span> for retrieving the value
string associated with a given key and <span class="code">prefnode.put(key,value)</span> for
setting the value string for a given key.</p>
   

<p>In <span class="code">Main.java</span>, I use preferences to store the shape and position of
the program's window.  This makes the size and shape of the window persistent
between runs of the program; when you run the program, the window will be right
where you left it the last time you ran it.  I also store the name of the directory
that is currently selected in the file dialog box that is used by the program for the Save and
Open commands.  This is particularly satisfying, since the default behavior
for a file dialog box is to start in the user's home directory, which is hardly
ever the place where the user wants to keep a program's files.  With the preferences
feature, I can switch to the right directory the first time I use the program,
and from then on I'll automatically be back in that directory when I use the program again.
You can look at the source code in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/edu/hws/eck/mdb/Main.java">Main.java</a></span>
for the details.</p>

programming in general, but this book is only "An Introduction to Programming with Java,"
and it's time for our journey to end.  I hope that it has been a pleasant journey
for you, and I hope that I have helped you establish a foundation that you can
