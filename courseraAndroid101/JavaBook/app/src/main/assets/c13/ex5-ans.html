<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 13.5</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.5:</h3>
<p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java">PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java</a></span>
from <a href="../c11/s3.html#IO.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;11.3.2</a> keeps data for a "phone directory" in a file in the user's
home directory.  <a href="../c11/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.5</a> asked you to revise that program to
use an XML format for the data.  Both programs have a simple command-line user
interface.  For this exercise, you should provide a GUI interface for the
phone directory data.  You can base your program either on the original sample
program or on the modified version from the exercise.  Use a <span class="classname">JTable</span>
to hold the data.  The user should be able to edit all the entries in the
table.  Also, the user should be able to add and delete rows.  Include either
buttons or menu commands that can be used to perform these actions.  The
delete command should delete the selected row, if any.   New rows should be
added at the end of the table.
For this program, you can use a standard <span class="classname">DefaultTableModel</span>.</p>

<p>Your program should load data from the file when it starts and save data to the
file when it ends, just as the two previous programs do.  For a GUI program, you can't
simply save the data at the end of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, since <span class="code">main()</span>
terminates as soon as the window shows up on the screen.  You want to save the
data when the user closes the window and ends the program.  There are several
approaches.  One is to use a <span class="classname">WindowListener</span> to detect
the event that occurs when the window closes.  Another is to use a "Quit"
command to end the program; when the user quits, you can save the data and
close the window  (by calling its <span class="code">dispose()</span> method), and end the program.
If you use the "Quit" command approach, you don't want the user to be
able to end the program simply by closing the window.  To accomplish this,
you should call</p>

<pre>frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);</pre>

<p>where <span class="code">frame</span> refers to the <span class="classname">JFrame</span> that
you have created for the program's user interface.  When using a
<span class="classname">WindowListener</span>, you want the close box on the window to
close the window, not end the program.  For this, you need</p>

<pre>frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);</pre>

<p>When the listener is notified of a window closed event, it can
save the data and end the program.</p>

<p>Most of the <span class="classname">JTable</span> and <span class="classname">DefaultTableModel</span>
methods that you need for this exercise are discussed in <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.3</a>,
but there are a few more that you need to know about.  To determine
which row is selected in a <span class="classname">JTable</span>, call
<span class="code">table.getSelectedRow()</span>.  This method
returns the row number of the selected row, or returns <span class="code">-1</span> if no
row is selected.  To specify which cell is currently being edited, you can
use:</p>

<pre>table.setRowSelectionInterval(rowNum, rowNum);  // Selects row number rowNum. 
table.editCellAt( rowNum, colNum ); // Edit cell at position (rowNum,colNum).
phoneTable.getEditorComponent().requestFocus();  // Put input cursor in cell.</pre>

<p>One particularly troublesome point is that the data that is in the cell that
is currently being edited is not in the table model.  The value in the edit cell
is not put into the table model until after the editing is finished.  This means
that even though the user sees the data in the cell, it's not really part of the
table data yet.  If you lose that data, the user would be justified in complaining.
To make sure that you get the right data when you save the
data at the end of the program, you have to turn off editing before retrieving
the data from the model.  This can be done with the following method:</p>

<pre>private void stopEditing() {
   if (table.getCellEditor() != null)
      table.getCellEditor().stopCellEditing();
}</pre>

<p>This method must also be called before modifying the table by adding or
deleting rows; if such modifications are made while editing is in progress,
the effect can be very strange.</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>There are many, many ways to organize the program.  I will
discuss just one. The main GUI class in my program is a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>,
named <span class="classname">PhoneDirectoryPanel</span>.  This panel holds the table and
two buttons that are used for adding and deleting rows.  
In the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, the data from the file is read
into a variable of type <span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;String,String&gt;</span>.
Somehow, that data has to get into the panel.  I decided to pass it as a
parameter to a constructor of the form</p>

<pre>public PhoneDirectoryPanel(TreeMap&lt;String,String&gt; initialPhoneBook)</pre>

<p>When the program ends, the data has to be gotten back <b>out</b> of the
panel object so it can be saved to the file.  I defined a method in the
<span class="classname">PhoneDirectoryPanel</span> class that can be used to get
the data:</p> 

<pre>public TreeMap&lt;String, String&gt; getPhoneBook()</pre>

<p>Aside from the constructor, some instance variables, and the <span class="code">getPhoneBook()</span> method, the only
other thing in the panel class is the <span class="code">stopEditing()</span> method that was mentioned in the
exercise.  While the program is running, the data is managed by the table.</p>

<p>In the command-line version, the code for
saving the data is at the end of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine.  I
moved it into a static method</p>

<pre>private static void saveData(TreeMap&lt;String,String&gt; newPhoneBook)</pre>

<p>This method has to be called when the program ends.  I decided to use a 
<span class="classname">WindowListener</span> to save the data when the window is closed.
The <span class="code">main()</span> routine creates the window, puts a <span class="classname">PhoneDirectoryPanel</span>
in the window, and adds a listener to the window:</p>

<pre>JFrame window = new JFrame("PhoneBook");
final PhoneDirectoryPanel panel = new PhoneDirectoryPanel(phoneBook);
window.setContentPane( panel );
window.pack();
Dimension screenSize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();
window.setLocation( (screenSize.width - window.getWidth())/2, 80 );
window.setVisible(true);
window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);
window.addWindowListener( new WindowAdapter() {
      // When the user clicks the close box of the window,
      // the window will be disposed (that is, closed), and the
      // windowClosed method in this WindowListener will be 
      // called.  This method saves the phone book data and
      // calls System.exit() to terminate the program.
   public void windowClosed(WindowEvent evt) {
      saveData(panel.getPhoneBook());
      System.exit(0);
   }
});</pre>

<p>After it does this, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine ends, and the window takes
over.  The constructor of the panel class has to create a table and a table model
using the data from the <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>, <span class="code">initialPhoneBook</span>.
To do this, it copies the data into a two-dimensional array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>
that can be used in the constructor for the <span class="classname">DefaultTableModel</span>:
</p>

<pre>int entryCount = initialPhoneBook.size();
String[][] entries;
if (entryCount == 0)
    entries = new String[1][2]; // Represents an empty row.
else {
   entries = new String[entryCount][2];
   int index = 0;
   for (Map.Entry&lt;String, String&gt; entry : initialPhoneBook.entrySet()) {
      entries[index][0] = entry.getKey();
      entries[index][1] = entry.getValue();
      index++;
   }
}
String[] columnHeads = new String[] { "Name", "Number" };
 
model = new DefaultTableModel(entries,columnHeads);
table = new JTable(model);</pre>

<p>Note that if there are no entries in the phone book, I place one empty row
in the table, since the user would have to do that anyway before they could
do anything else with the table.  (Also, I need a real array when I create the model,
since the number of columns is taken from the size of the array.)
I also did some customization of the table's appearance.  The constructor
also creates an "Add Row" button and a "Delete Row" button.  It's worth
looking at the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> for the "Add Row" button:</p>

<pre>JButton addRowButton = new JButton("Add Row");
addRowButton.addActionListener( new ActionListener() {
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
          // Add a row at the end of the table.  Also, select
          // that row and set the first cell in that row to
          // be the cell that is currently being edited.
      stopEditing();
      model.addRow( new String[] { null, null } );
      int newRow = model.getRowCount() - 1;  // Number of the row that was added.
      table.setRowSelectionInterval(newRow, newRow);
      table.editCellAt( newRow, 0 );
      Component c = table.getEditorComponent();
      if (c != null) // (Should not be null.)
         c.requestFocus();
   }
});</pre>

<p>The statement <span class="code">model.addRow( new String[] { null, null } );</span> adds a row
at the end of the table.  The data that is to go into the cells in that row is passed
to the <span class="code">addRow()</span> method as an array.  In this case, the <span class="code">null</span>
values mean that both cells will initially be empty.  Before adding the row,
I call <span class="code">stopEditing()</span>, as suggested in the exercise, and after
adding the row, I select the first cell in the row for editing, again following the
exercise.</p>

<p>The only other thing to do in the panel class is to define the <span class="code">getPhoneBooK()</span> method.
This method has to get the data out of the table model and add it to a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>.
One question was, what to do about empty cells in the table?  A row with one or two empty
rows represents missing or incomplete data.  One possibility is just to ignore all such
rows.  However, I decided that having a name in the phone book with no number attached to
it would be OK.  On the other hand, it doesn't make any sense to have a number without a
name, so my policy is to ignore any row in which the "name" cell is empty.  You can see
how it's done in the solution shown below.</p>

<p>One other issue that came up is what to do if an error occurs while trying to
read or write the data file.  The command-line version of the program simply prints
a message to standard output.  For a GUI program, however, the user probably won't
even see standard output, so sending the output there does no good.  A much
better way to report errors in a GUI program is to use the <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span>
class, so I converted error reports from the original program to use
<span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> instead of <span class="code">System.out</span>.</p>
