<h2 class="section_title">Actions and Buttons</h2>
<hr class="break">
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>F</big>or the past two sections</span>, we have been looking
at some  of the more advanced aspects of the Java graphics API.  But the
heart of most graphical user interface programming is using GUI components.
In this section and the next, we'll be looking at <span class="classname">JComponents</span>.
We'll cover several component classes that were not covered in <a href="../c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>,
as well as some additional features of classes that were covered there.</p>
   

<p>This section is mostly about buttons.  Buttons are among the simplest of
GUI components, and it seems like there shouldn't be all that much to say
about them.  However, buttons are not as simple as they seem.  For one thing,
there are many different types of buttons.  The basic functionality of
buttons in Java is defined by the class <span class="code">javax.swing.AbstractButton</span>.
Subclasses of this class represent push buttons, check boxes, and radio
buttons.  Menu items are also considered to be buttons.  The
<span class="classname">AbstractButton</span> class defines a surprisingly
large API for controlling the appearance of buttons.  This section will
cover part of that API, but you should see the class documentation for
full details.</p>
   

<p>In this section, we'll also encounter a few classes that do not themselves define
buttons but that are related to the button API, starting with "actions."</p>
   
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.3.1">13.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Action and AbstractAction</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">JButton</span> class represents push buttons.  Up until
now, we have created push buttons using the constructor</p>
   

<pre>public JButton(String text);</pre>
   

<p>which specifies text that will appear on the button.  We then added an
<span class="classname">ActionListener</span> to the button, to respond when the
user presses it.  Another way to create a <span class="classname">JButton</span> is
using an <span class="classname">Action</span>.  The <span class="classname">Action</span>
interface represents the general idea of some action that can be performed,
together with properties associated with that action, such as a name for
the action, an icon that represents the action, and whether the action
is currently enabled or disabled.  <span class="classname">Actions</span> are
usually defined using the class <span class="classname">AbstractAction</span>,
an <span class="code">abstract</span> class which includes a method</p>
   

<pre>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)</pre>
   

<p>that must be defined in any concrete subclass.  Often, this is done
in an anonymous inner class.  For example, if <span class="code">display</span>
is an object that has a <span class="classname">clear()</span> method,
an <span class="classname">Action</span> object that represents the action 
"clear the display" might be defined as:</p>
   

<pre>Action clearAction = new AbstractAction("Clear") {
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) { 
      display.clear();
   }
};</pre>
   

<p>The parameter, <span class="code">"Clear"</span>, in the constructor of the
<span class="classname">AbstractAction</span> is the name of the action.  Other
properties can be set by calling the method <span class="code">putValue(key,value)</span>,
which is part of the <span class="classname">Action</span> interface.  For example,</p>
   

<pre>clearAction.putValue(Action.SHORT_DESCRIPTION, "Clear the Display");</pre>
   

<p>sets the <span class="code">SHORT_DESCRIPTION</span> property of the action to
have the value "Clear the Display".  The <span class="code">key</span> parameter 
in the <span class="code">putValue()</span> method is usually given as one of several
constants defined in the <span class="classname">Action</span> interface.  As
another example, you can change the name of an action by using
<span class="code">Action.NAME</span> as the <span class="code">key</span> in the <span class="code">putValue()</span>
method.</p>
   

<p>Once you have an <span class="classname">Action</span>, you can use it in the constructor
of a button.  For example, using the action <span class="code">clearAction</span> defined
above, we can create the <span class="classname">JButton</span>
</p>
   

<pre>JButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction );</pre>
   

<p>The name of the action will be used as the text of the button,
and some other properties of the button will be taken from properties of the
action.  For example, if the <span class="code">SHORT_DESCRIPTION</span> property of the
action has a value, then that value is used as the tooltip text for
the button.  (The tooltip text appears when the user hovers the mouse
over the button.)  Furthermore, when you change a property of the
action, the corresponding property of the button will also be
changed.</p>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">Action</span> interface defines a <span class="code">setEnabled()</span>
method that is used to enable and disable the action.  The <span class="code">clearAction</span> action can be enabled
and disabled by calling <span class="code">clearAction.setEnabled(true)</span> and
<span class="code">clearAction.setEnabled(false)</span>.  When you do this, any button that
has been created from the action is also enabled or disabled at the same time.</p>
   

<p>Now of course, the question is, <b>why</b> should you want to use <span class="classname">Actions</span>
at all?  One advantage is that using actions can help you to organize your code
better.  You can create separate objects that represent each of the actions that
can be performed in your program.  This represents a nice division of responsibility.
Of course, you could do the same thing with individual <span class="classname">ActionListener</span>
objects, but then you couldn't associate descriptions and other properties with
the actions.</p>
   

<p>More important is the fact that <span class="classname">Actions</span> can also be used in
other places in the Java API.  You can use an <span class="classname">Action</span> to create
a <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span> in the same way as for a <span class="classname">JButton</span>:</p>
   

<pre>JMenuItem clearCommand = new JMenuItem( clearAction );</pre>
   

<p>A <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span>, in fact, is a kind of button and shares many
of the same properties that a <span class="classname">JButton</span> can have.  You can use
the <b>same</b> <span class="classname">Action</span> to create both a button and a menu
item (or even several of each if you want).
Whenever you enable or disable the action or change its name, the button and the
menu item will <b>both</b> be changed to match.  If you change the <span class="code">NAME</span>
property of the action, the text of both the menu item and the button will be
set to the new name of the action.  If you disable the action, both menu item
and button will be disabled.  You can think of the button and
the menu items as being two presentations of the <span class="classname">Action</span>,
and you don't have to keep track of the button or menu item after you create them.
You can do everything that you need to do by manipulating the <span class="classname">Action</span>
object.</p>
   

<p>It is also possible to associate an <span class="classname">Action</span> with a
key on the keyboard, so that the action will be performed whenever the user presses that
key.  I won't explain how to do it here, but you can look up the
documentation for the classes <span class="code">javax.swing.InputMap</span> and
<span class="code">javax.swing.ActionMap</span>.</p>
   

<p>By the way, if you want to add a menu item that is defined by an <span class="classname">Action</span>
to a menu, you don't even need to create the <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span> yourself.
You can add the action object directly to the menu, and the menu item will be created
from the properties of the action.  For example, if <span class="code">menu</span> is a <span class="classname">JMenu</span>
and <span class="code">clearAction</span> is an <span class="classname">Action</span>, you can simply say
<span class="code">menu.add(clearAction)</span>.</p>
   

      
   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.3.2">13.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons on Buttons</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In addition to -- or instead of -- text, buttons can also show icons.
Icons are represented by the <span class="classname">Icon</span> interface and are usually
created as <span class="classname">ImageIcons</span>, as discussed in <a href="../c13/s1.html#GUI2.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;13.1.4</a>.
For example, here is a picture of a button that displays an image of a large "X"
as its icon:</p>
   

<p align="center">
<img src="clearButton.png" width="134" height="38" alt="a JButton with both text and an icon"></p>
   

<p>The icon for a button can be set by calling the button's <span class="code">setIcon()</span> method,
or by passing the icon object as a parameter to the constructor when the button is created.
To create the button shown above, I created an <span class="classname">ImageIcon</span> from a
<span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> on which I drew the picture that I wanted, and
I constructed the <span class="classname">JButton</span> using a constructor that takes
both the text and the icon for the button as parameters.  Here's the code segment
that does it:</p>
   

<pre>BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(24,24,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
 
Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)image.getGraphics();
g2.setColor(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);             // Draw the image for the icon.
g2.fillRect(0,0,24,24);
g2.setStroke( new BasicStroke(3) );        //    Use thick lines.
g2.setColor(Color.BLACK);
g2.drawLine(4,4,20,20);                    //    Draw the "X".
g2.drawLine(4,20,20,4);
g2.dispose();

Icon clearIcon = new ImageIcon(image);     // Create the icon.

JButton clearButton = new JButton("Clear the Display", clearIcon);</pre>   


<p>You can create a button with an icon but no text by using a constructor
that takes just the icon as parameter.  Another alternative is for the
button to get its icon from an <span class="classname">Action</span>.  When a button
is constructed from an action, it takes its icon from the value of the
action property <span class="code">Action.SMALL_ICON</span>.  For example, suppose that
we want to use an action named <span class="code">clearAction</span> to create the
button shown above.  This could be done with:</p>


<pre>clearAction.putValue( Action.SMALL_ICON, clearIcon );
JButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction );</pre>
   

<p>The icon could also be associated with the action by passing it
as a parameter to the constructor of an <span class="classname">AbstractAction</span>:</p>
   

<pre>Action clearAction = new AbstractAction("Clear the Display", clearIcon) {
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
      .
      .  // Carry out the action.
      .
   }  
}
JButton clearButton = new JButton( clearAction );</pre>


<p>(In Java 6.0 and later, a button will use the value of the 
<span class="code">Action.LARGE_ICON_KEY</span> property of the action, if that property
has a value, in preference to <span class="code">Action.SMALL_ICON</span>.)</p>
   


<p>The appearance of buttons can be tweaked in many ways.  For example, you
can change the size of the gap between the button's text and its icon.  You can
associate additional icons with a button that are used when the button is
in certain states, such as when it is pressed or when it is disabled.  
It is even possible to change the positioning of the text with respect to
the icon.  For example, to place the text centered below the icon on
a button, you can say:</p>


<pre>button.setHorizontalTextPosition(JButton.CENTER);
button.setVerticalTextPosition(JButton.BOTTOM);</pre>
   

<p>These methods and many others are defined in the
class <span class="classname">AbstractButton</span>.  This class is a superclass
for <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span>, as well as for <span class="classname">JButton</span>
and for the classes that define
check boxes and radio buttons.  Note in particular that an icon can be shown in a menu by
associating the icon with a menu item or with the action that is used to
create the menu item.</p>
   

<p>Finally, I will mention that it is possible to use icons on <span class="classname">JLabels</span>
in much the same way that they can be used on <span class="classname">JButtons</span>.
Placing an <span class="classname">ImageIcon</span> on a <span class="classname">JLabel</span>
can be a convenient way to add a static image to your GUI.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.3.3">13.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio Buttons</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> class was covered in 
<a href="../c6/s6.html#GUI1.6.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.6.3</a>, and the equivalent for use in menus,
<span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>, in <a href="../c6/s8.html#GUI1.8.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.8.1</a>.
A checkbox has two states, selected and not selected, and the user
can change the state by clicking on the check box.  The state
of a checkbox can also be set programmatically by calling its
<span class="code">setSelected()</span> method, and the current value of the
state can be checked using the <span class="code">isSelected()</span> method.</p>
   

<p>Closely related to checkboxes are <span class="newword">radio buttons</span>.
Like a checkbox, a radio button can be either selected or not.  However,
radio buttons are expected to occur in groups, and at most one radio button in a
group can be selected at any given time. In Java, a radio button is represented
by an object of type <span class="classname">JRadioButton</span>. When used in isolation, a
<span class="classname">JRadioButton</span> acts just like a <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>, 
and it has the same
methods and events. Ordinarily, however, a <span class="classname">JRadioButton</span> is used in a
group. A group of radio buttons is represented by an object belonging to the
class <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span>. A <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> is <b>not</b> a component
and does not itself have a visible representation on the screen. A
<span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> works behind the scenes to organize a group of radio
buttons, to ensure that at most one button in the group can be selected at any given
time.</p>


<p>To use a group of radio buttons, you must create a <span class="classname">JRadioButton</span>
object for each button in the group, and you must create one object of type
<span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> to organize the individual buttons into a group. Each
<span class="classname">JRadioButton</span> must be added individually to some container, so that it
will appear on the screen. (A <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> plays no role in the
placement of the buttons on the screen.) Each <span class="classname">JRadioButton</span> must also
be added to the <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span>, which has an <span class="code">add()</span> method for
this purpose. If you want one of the buttons to be selected initially, you
can call <span class="code">setSelected(true)</span> for that button. If you don't do this, then
none of the buttons will be selected until the user clicks on one of them.</p>


<p>As an example, here is how you could set up a set of radio buttons that can
be used to select a color:</p>


<pre>JRadioButton redRadio, blueRadio, greenRadio, blackRadio;
         // Variables to represent the radio buttons.
         // These should probably be instance variables, so
         // that they can be used throughout the program.
 
ButtonGroup colorGroup = new ButtonGroup();

redRadio = new JRadioButton("Red");  // Create a button.
colorGroup.add(redRadio);            // Add it to the group.
   
blueRadio = new JRadioButton("Blue");
colorGroup.add(blueRadio);
 
greenRadio = new JRadioButton("Green");
colorGroup.add(greenRadio);
 
blackRadio = new JRadioButton("Black");
colorGroup.add(blackRadio);
 
redRadio.setSelected(true);  // Make an initial selection.</pre>


<p>The individual buttons must still be added to a container if they are to
appear on the screen. If you want to respond immediately when the user clicks
on one of the radio buttons, you can register an <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> for
each button.  Just as for
checkboxes, it is not always necessary to register listeners for radio buttons.
In some cases, you can simply check the state of each button when you need to
know it, using the button's <span class="code">isSelected()</span> method.</p>
   

<p>All this is demonstrated in the sample program 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/RadioButtonDemo.java">RadioButtonDemo.java</a></span>.
The program shows four radio buttons.  When the user selects one of
the radio buttons, the text and background color of a label is changed.
Here is an applet version of the program:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="RadioButtonDemo$Applet.class" width="202" height="202" archive="RadioButtonDemo.jar" alt="(Applet 'RadioButtonDemo' should be displayed here.)"></applet></p>

      

<p>You can add the equivalent of a group of radio buttons to a menu by using
the class <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItem</span>.  To use this class,
create several objects of this type, and create a <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span>
to manage them.  Add each <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItem</span> to
the <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span>, and also add them to
a <span class="classname">JMenu</span>.  If you want one of the items to be selected
initially, call its <span class="code">setSelected()</span> method to set its selection state
to true.  You can add <span class="classname">ActionListeners</span> to each
<span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItem</span> if you need to take some action
when the user selects the menu item; if not, you can simply check the selected states
of the buttons whenever you need to know them.  As an example, suppose that
<span class="code">menu</span> is a <span class="classname">JMenu</span>.  Then you can add a
group of buttons to <span class="code">menu</span> as follows:</p>
   

<pre>JRadioButtonMenuItem selectRedItem, selectGreenItem, selectBlueItem;
   // These might be defined as instance variables
ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();
selectRedItem = new JRadioButtonMenuItem("Red");
group.add(selectRedItem);
menu.add(selectRedItem);
selectGreenItem = new JRadioButtonMenuItem("Green");
group.add(selectGreenItem);
menu.add(selectGreenItem);
selectBlueItem = new JRadioButtonMenuItem("Blue");
group.add(selectBlueItem);
menu.add(selectBlueItem);</pre>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>When it's drawn on the screen, a <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> includes
a little box that is either checked or unchecked to show the state of the box.
That box is actually a pair of <span class="classname">Icons</span>.
One icon is shown when the check box is unselected; the other is shown when it
is selected.  You can change the appearance of the check box by substituting
different icons for the standard ones.</p>
   

<p>The icon that is shown when the check box is unselected is just the main
icon for the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>.  You can provide a different
unselected icon in the constructor or you can change the icon using the
<span class="code">setIcon()</span> method of the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> object.
To change the icon that is shown when the check box is selected, use
the <span class="code">setSelectedIcon()</span> method of the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>.
All this applies equally to <span class="classname">JRadioButton</span>,
<span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>, and <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItem</span>.
</p>
   

<p>An example of this can be found in the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/ToolBarDemo.java">ToolBarDemo.java</a></span>,
which is discussed in the next subsection.  That program creates a set of radio buttons
that use custom icons.  The buttons are created by the following method:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Create a JRadioButton and add it to a specified button group.  The button
 * is meant for selecting a drawing color in the display.  The color is used to 
 * create two custom icons, one for the unselected state of the button and one
 * for the selected state.  These icons are used instead of the usual
 * radio button icons.
 * @param c the color of the button, and the color to be used for drawing.
 *    (Note that c has to be "final" since it is used in the anonymous inner
 *    class that defines the response to ActionEvents on the button.)
 * @param grp the ButtonGroup to which the radio button will be added.
 * @param selected if true, then the state of the button is set to selected.
 * @return the radio button that was just created; sorry, but the button
      is not as pretty as I would like!
 */
private JRadioButton makeColorRadioButton(final Color c, 
                                           ButtonGroup grp, boolean selected) {
   
   /* Create an ImageIcon for the normal, unselected state of the button,
      using a BufferedImage that is drawn here from scratch. */
   
   BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(30,30,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
   Graphics g = image.getGraphics();
   g.setColor(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);
   g.fillRect(0,0,30,30);
   g.setColor(c);
   g.fill3DRect(1, 1, 24, 24, true);
   g.dispose();
   Icon unselectedIcon = new ImageIcon(image);
   
   /* Create an ImageIcon for the selected state of the button. */
 
   image = new BufferedImage(30,30,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
   g = image.getGraphics();
   g.setColor(Color.DARK_GRAY);
   g.fillRect(0,0,30,30);
   g.setColor(c);
   g.fill3DRect(3, 3, 24, 24, false);
   g.dispose();
   Icon selectedIcon = new ImageIcon(image);
   
   /* Create and configure the button. */

   JRadioButton button = new JRadioButton(unselectedIcon);
   button.setSelectedIcon(selectedIcon);
   button.addActionListener( new ActionListener() {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           // The action for this button sets the current drawing color
           // in the display to c.
         display.setCurrentColor(c);
      }
   });
   grp.add(button);
   if (selected)
      button.setSelected(true);

   return button;
} // end makeColorRadioButton </pre>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>It is possible to create radio buttons and check boxes from <span class="classname">Actions</span>.
The button takes its name, main icon, tooltip text, and enabled/disabled state from the
action.  In Java 5.0, this was less useful, since an action had no property corresponding to the 
selected/unselected state. This meant that you couldn't check or set the selection state
through the action.  In Java&nbsp;6, the action API is considerably improved,
and among the changes is support for selection state.  In Java&nbsp;6, the selected state of
an <span class="classname">Action</span> named <span class="code">action</span> can be set by calling
<span class="code">action.putValue(Action.SELECTED_KEY,true)</span> and
<span class="code">action.putValue(Action.SELECTED_KEY,false)</span>.  When you do this, the
selection state of any checkbox or radio button that was created from <span class="code">action</span>
is automatically changed to match.  Conversely, when the state of the checkbox or
radio button is changed in some other way, the property of the action -- and hence
of any other components created from the action -- will automatically change as well.
The state can be checked by calling <span class="code">action.getValue(Action.SELECTED_KEY)</span>.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="GUI2.3.4">13.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Toolbars</a>
</h3>
   

<p>It has become increasingly common for programs to have a row of small buttons
along the top or side of the program window that offer access to some of the
commonly used features of the program.  The row of buttons is known as a
<span class="newword">tool bar</span>.  Typically, the buttons in a tool bar are presented
as small icons, with no text.  Tool bars can also contain other components,
such as <span class="classname">JTextFields</span> and <span class="classname">JLabels</span>.</p>
   

<p>In Swing, tool bars are represented by the class <span class="classname">JToolBar</span>.
A <span class="classname">JToolBar</span> is a container that can hold other components.
It is also itself a component, and so can be added to other containers.  In general,
the parent component of the tool bar should use a <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>.
The tool bar should occupy one of the edge positions -- <span class="code">NORTH</span>,
<span class="code">SOUTH</span>, <span class="code">EAST</span>, or <span class="code">WEST</span> -- in the
<span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>.  Furthermore, the other three edge positions
should be empty.  The reason for this is that it might be possible (depending
on the platform and configuration) for the user to drag the tool bar from one edge position in
the parent container to another.  It might even be possible for the user to drag the
tool bar off its parent entirely, so that it becomes a separate window.</p>
   

<p>The sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/ToolBarDemo.java">ToolBarDemo.java</a></span> demonstrates the use of a tool bar.
Here is an applet version of the program.  The tool bar is at the top
of the applet:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="ToolBarDemo$Applet.class" width="300" height="300" archive="ToolBarDemo.jar" alt="An applet that demos a tool bar"></applet></p>
   

<p>In this program, you can draw colored curves in the large white
drawing area.  The first three buttons in the tool bar are a set
of radio buttons that control the drawing color.  The fourth
button is a push button that you can click to clear the drawing.
</p>
   

<p>Tool bars are easy to use.  You just have to create the <span class="classname">JToolBar</span>
object, add it to a container, and add some buttons and possibly other components to
the tool bar.  One fine point is adding space to a tool bar, such as the gap between
the radio buttons and the push button in the sample program.  You can leave
a gap by adding a separator to the tool bar.  For example:</p>
   

<pre>toolbar.addSeparator(new Dimension(20,20));</pre>
   

<p>This adds an invisible 20-by-20 pixel block to the tool bar.  This will appear
as a 20 pixel gap between components.</p>
   

<p>Here is the constructor from the <span class="code">ToolBarDemo</span> program. 
It shows how to create the tool bar and place it in a container.  Note that
class <span class="classname">ToolBarDemo</span> is a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>,
and the tool bar and display are added to the panel object that is being constructed:</p>
   

<pre>public ToolBarDemo() {
   
   setLayout(new BorderLayout(2,2));
   setBackground(Color.GRAY);
   setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.GRAY,2));
   
   display = new Display();
   add(display, BorderLayout.CENTER);
   
   JToolBar toolbar = new JToolBar();
   add(toolbar, BorderLayout.NORTH);
   
   ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();
   toolbar.add( makeColorRadioButton(Color.RED,group,true) );
   toolbar.add( makeColorRadioButton(Color.GREEN,group,false) );
   toolbar.add( makeColorRadioButton(Color.BLUE,group,false) );
   toolbar.addSeparator(new Dimension(20,20));
   
   toolbar.add( makeClearButton() );
   
}</pre>
   

<p>Note that the gray outline of the tool bar comes from
two sources:  The line at the bottom shows the background color of the main panel,
which is visible because the <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> that is used
on that panel has vertical and horizontal gaps of 2 pixels.  The other three
sides are part of the border of the main panel.</p>
   

<p>If you want a vertical tool bar that can be placed in the <span class="code">EAST</span>
or <span class="code">WEST</span> position of a <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>,
you should specify the orientation in the tool bar's constructor:</p>
   

<pre>JToolBar toolbar = new JToolBar( JToolBar.VERTICAL );</pre>
   

<p>The default orientation is <span class="code">JToolBar.HORIZONTAL</span>.  The
orientation is adjusted automatically when the user drags the tool bar
into a new position.  If you want to prevent the user from dragging
the tool bar, just say <span class="code">toolbar.setFloatable(false)</span>.</p>

<a name="GUI2.3.5">13.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Keyboard Accelerators</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In most programs, commonly used menu commands have keyboard equivalents.
The user can type the keyboard equivalent instead of selecting the command
from the menu, and the result will be exactly the same.  Typically, for
example, the "Save" command has keyboard equivalent <span class="code">CONTROL-S</span>,
and the "Undo" command corresponds to <span class="code">CONTROL-Z</span>.  (Under
Mac OS, the keyboard equivalents for these commands would probably
be <span class="code">META-S</span> and <span class="code">META-Z</span>, where <span class="code">META</span>
refers to holding down the "apple" key.)  The keyboard equivalents
for menu commands are referred to as <span class="newword">accelerators</span>.</p>
   

<p>The class <span class="code">javax.swing.KeyStroke</span> is used to represent
key strokes that the user can type on the keyboard.  A key stroke consists
of pressing a key, possibly while holding down one or more of the
modifier keys <span class="code">control</span>, <span class="code">shift</span>, <span class="code">alt</span>,
and <span class="code">meta</span>.  The <span class="classname">KeyStroke</span> class has
a static method, <span class="code">getKeyStroke(String)</span>, that makes it easy to 
create key stroke objects.  For example,</p>


<pre>KeyStroke.getKeyStroke( "ctrl S" )</pre>
   

<p>returns a <span class="classname">KeyStroke</span> that represents the action
of pressing the "S" key while holding down the control key.  In addition
to "ctrl", you can use the modifiers "shift", "alt", and "meta" in the
string that describes the key stroke.  You can even combine several modifiers,
so that</p>
   

<pre>KeyStroke.getKeyStroke( "ctrl shift Z" )</pre>
   

<p>represents the action of pressing the "Z" key while holding down both
the control and the shift keys.  When the key stroke involves pressing a
character key, the character must appear in the string in upper case
form.  You can also have key strokes that correspond to non-character
keys.  The number keys can be referred to as "1", "2", etc., while
certain special keys have names such as "F1", "ENTER", and "LEFT"
(for the left arrow key).  The class <span class="classname">KeyEvent</span>
defines many constants such as <span class="code">VK_ENTER</span>, <span class="code">VK_LEFT</span>,
and <span class="code">VK_S</span>.  The names that are used for keys in the
keystroke description are just these constants with the leading
"<span class="code">VK_</span>" removed.</p>
   

<p>There are at least two ways to associate a keyboard accelerator with
a menu item.  One is to use the <span class="code">setAccelerator()</span> method
of the menu item object:</p>
   

<pre>JMenuItem saveCommand = new JMenuItem( "Save..." );
saveCommand.setAccelerator( KeyStroke.getKeyStroke("ctrl S") );</pre>
   

<p>The other technique can be used if the menu item is created from 
an <span class="classname">Action</span>.  The action property
<span class="code">Action.ACCELERATOR_KEY</span> can be used to associate a
<span class="classname">KeyStroke</span> with an <span class="classname">Action</span>.
When a menu item is created from the action, the keyboard accelerator
for the menu item is taken from the value of this property.  For
example, if <span class="code">redoAction</span> is an <span class="classname">Action</span>
representing a "Redo" action, then you might say:</p>
   

<pre>redoAction.putValue( Action.ACCELERATOR_KEY, 
                              KeyStroke.getKeyStroke("ctrl shift Z") );
JMenuItem redoCommand = new JMenuItem( redoAction );</pre>
   

<p>or, alternatively, you could simply add the action to a <span class="classname">JMenu</span>,
<span class="code">editMenu</span>, with <span class="code">editMenu.add(redoAction)</span>.
(Note, by the way, that accelerators apply only to menu items, not to
push buttons.  When you create a <span class="classname">JButton</span> from an
action, the <span class="code">ACCELERATOR_KEY</span> property of the action is ignored.)</p>
   

<p>Note that you can use accelerators for <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItems</span>
and <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItems</span>, as well as for simple
<span class="classname">JMenuItems</span>.</p>
   

<p>For an example of using keyboard accelerators, see the solution to
<a href="../c13/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;13.2</a>.</p>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>By the way, as noted above, in the Mac&nbsp;OS operating system, the
meta (or apple) key is usually used for keyboard accelerators instead of
the control key.  If you would like to make your program more Mac-friendly,
you can test whether your program is running under Mac&nbsp;OS and, if so,
adapt your accelerators to the Mac&nbsp;OS style.  The recommended way to
detect Mac&nbsp;OS is to test the value of <span class="code">System.getProperty("mrj.version")</span>.
This function call happens to return a non-null value under Mac&nbsp;OS but returns
null under other operating systems. For example, here is a simple
utility routine for making Mac-friendly accelerators:</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * Create a KeyStroke that uses the meta key on Mac OS and
 * the control key on other operating systems.
 * @param description a string that describes the keystroke,
 *   without the "meta" or "ctrl"; for example, "S" or
 *   "shift Z" or "alt F1"
 * @return a keystroke created from the description string
 *   with either "ctrl " or "meta " prepended
 */
private static KeyStroke makeAccelerator(String description) {
   String commandKey;
   if ( System.getProperty("mrj.version") == null )
      commandKey = "ctrl";
   else
      commandKey = "meta";
   return KeyStroke.getKeyStroke( commandKey + " " + description );
}</pre>

<a name="GUI2.3.6">13.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML on Buttons</a>
</h3>
   

<p>As a final stop in this brief tour of ways to spiff up your buttons,
I'll mention the fact that the text that is displayed on a button can
be specified in HTML format.  HTML is the markup language that is used to
write web pages.  A brief introduction to HTML can be found in <a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.2.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.2.3</a>.
HTML allows you to apply color or italics
or other styles to just part of the text on your buttons.  It also makes
it possible to have buttons that display multiple lines of text.
(You can also use HTML on <span class="classname">JLabels</span>,
which can be even more useful.)   
Here's a picture of a button with HTML text (along with a "Java" icon):</p>
   

<p align="center">
<img src="java_button.png" width="161" height="66" alt="button with HTML text"></p>
   

<p>If the string of text that is applied to a button starts with "<span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span>",
then the string is interpreted as HTML.  The string does not have to use strict
HTML format; for example, you don't need a closing <span class="code">&lt;/html&gt;</span> at the end of
the string.  To get multi-line text, use <span class="code">&lt;br&gt;</span> in the string
to represent line breaks.  If you would like the lines of text to be center
justified, include the entire text (except for the <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span>) between
<span class="code">&lt;center&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;/center&gt;</span>.  For example,</p>
   

<pre>JButton button = new JButton(
               "&lt;html&gt;&lt;center&gt;This button has&lt;br&gt;two lines of text&lt;/center&gt;" );</pre>
   

<p>creates a button that displays two centered lines of text.  You can apply italics
to part of the string by enclosing that part between <span class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> and
<span class="code">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.  Similarly, use <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</span>
for bold text and <span class="code">&lt;u&gt;...&lt;/u&gt;</span> for underlined text.
For green text, enclose the text between <span class="code">&lt;font&nbsp;color=green&gt;</span>
and <span class="code">&lt;/font&nbsp;&gt;</span>.  You can, of course, use other colors
in place of "green."  The "Java" button that is shown above was created using:</p>
   

<pre>JButton javaButton = new JButton( "&lt;html&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now&lt;/b&gt; is the time for&lt;br&gt;" +
                           "a nice cup of &lt;font color=red&gt;coffee&lt;/font&gt;." );</pre>
   

<p>Other HTML features can also be used on buttons and labels -- experiment to see
what you can get away with!</p>
