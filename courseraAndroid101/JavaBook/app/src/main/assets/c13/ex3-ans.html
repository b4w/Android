<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 13.3</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.3:</h3>
<p>The <span class="classname">StopWatchLabel</span>
component from <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.5</a> displays the text "Timing..."
when the stop watch is running. It would be nice if it displayed the elapsed
time since the stop watch was started. For that, you need to create a
<span class="classname">Timer</span>. (See <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.5.1</a>.)
Add a <span class="classname">Timer</span> to the original source code, 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/StopWatchLabel.java">StopWatchLabel.java</a></span>, to drive the display of the elapsed time in
seconds. Create the timer in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine when the stop
watch is started. Stop the timer in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine when
the stop watch is stopped. The elapsed time won't be very accurate anyway, so
just show the integral number of seconds. You only need to set the text a few
times per second. For my <span class="classname">Timer</span> method, I use a delay of 200
milliseconds for the timer. Here is an applet that tests my solution to this
exercise:</p>


<p align="center">
<applet code="TestStopWatch2.class" width="350" height="50" archive="TestStopWatch2.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<p>This one is almost too easy. (The hardest part is that I referred to the
stop watch as a "timer" in my program, and this could be confused with a
<span class="classname">Timer</span> object, so I changed some of the old references to
"timer" to "stop watch".)</p>


<p>An instance variable named <span class="code">timer</span> of type
<span class="classname">Timer</span> is added to the class. The timer is started when the stop watch
is started and is stopped when the stop watch is stopped. Both of these things
happen in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method. I could have created a new timer
each time the stop watch is started, but I decided to reuse a single timer. The
first time the stop watch is started, a <span class="classname">Timer</span>  object is created and
started. After that, the same <span class="classname">Timer</span>  object is simply restarted. I can
tell the difference between these two cases since the first time, the timer
will be <span class="code">null</span>:</p>


<pre>if (timer == null) {
   timer = new Timer(200,this);
   timer.start();
}
else
   timer.restart();</pre>


<p>The class is declared to implement <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> so that it can
respond to events from the timer. (As usual, it would probably be better style
to create another object to do the listening.) The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span>
method just has to set the text on the label to show how much time has passed
since the stop watch was started. The starting time of the stop watch is in the
instance variable <span class="code">startTime</span>. The current time is given by
<span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span>, so the elapsed time, in milliseconds, is
just <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime</span>. This has to be divided by
1000 to give the number of seconds. (Remember that dividing an integer by an
integer always gives an integer. The answer is truncated by dropping the fractional part, giving the
integral number of seconds.) The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method simply does
this calculation and then sets the text of the label.</p>


<p>The complete source code is shown below, followed by the source code for the
little applet that tests the component. The applet sets the fonts and colors of
the stop watch component.</p>
