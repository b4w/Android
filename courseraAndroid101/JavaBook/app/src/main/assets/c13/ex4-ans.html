<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.4:</h3>
<p>The custom component example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/MirrorText.java">MirrorText.java</a></span>,
from <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.5</a>, uses an off-screen canvas to show mirror-reversed text in
a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.  An alternative approach would be to draw the text
after applying a transform to the graphics context that is used for drawing.
(See <a href="../c13/s2.html#GUI2.2.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.2.5</a>.)  With this approach, the custom component can be defined
as a subclass of <span class="classname">JLabel</span> in which the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method is overridden.  Write a version of the <span class="code">MirrorText</span> component that
takes this approach.  The solution is very short, but tricky.  Note that the scale
transform <span class="code">g2.scale(-1,1)</span> does a left-right reflection through the
left edge of the component.</p>

<p>The original version of <span class="classname">MirrorText</span> was
defined as a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>, so it inherited only the
methods defined in that class.  Since <span class="classname">JPanel</span> has no
<span class="code">setText()</span> or <span class="code">getText()</span> method, I had to define them
myself.  To make the custom component behave like a normal component, I had
to define a <span class="code">getPreferredSize()</span> method, and I had to call
<span class="code">revalidate()</span> in the <span class="code">setText()</span> method.  And my component
still does not behave exactly like a standard component.  For example, a
<span class="classname">JLabel</span> generates an event when its text is changed.</p>

<p>By defining the new version of <span class="classname">MirrorText</span> as a
subclass of <span class="classname">JLabel</span>, we avoid these problems, since
the custom component will automatically have all the methods and behaviors
of a <span class="classname">JLabel</span>.  The main thing that has to be changed
is the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method.  I also defined a constructor
that sets the default alignment of the text in the label to centered rather
than left-justified. In the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, I used</p>

<pre>Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g.create();</pre>

<p>to get a <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span> graphics context for drawing on
the label.  This is required since transforms are only defined in <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span>
class.  I used <span class="code">(Graphics2D)g.create()</span> rather than simply
<span class="code">(Graphics2D)g</span> because I wanted to avoid changing the original graphics
context, which might be used for further drawing after the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
method finishes.  (See <a href="../c13/s2.html">Section&nbsp;13.2</a>).  To apply a mirror reversal to
the label, I used  <span class="code">g2.scale(-1,1)</span>, as suggested in the exercise.
However, this reflects the contents of the label through the left edge of the label.
If that were the only thing that I did, the text would end up on the other side of
the left edge, and that means it wouldn't appear on the label at all.  To fix this,
<b>before</b> scaling, I translate the text to the left by an amount equal to the width of the
label, with the command <span class="code">g2.translate(getWidth(),0)</span>.
This puts the text to the left of the label, and then the scale transform reflects
it back onto the label.  Finally, I call <span class="code">super.paintComponent(g2)</span> to
call the paint method from the <span class="classname">JLabel</span> class.  This will
draw the text of the label, but the drawing will be subject to the transforms
that have been applied to&nbsp;<span class="code">g2</span>.</p>

<p>The way I did it is not the only way to apply the transforms.  One alternative is
to use <span class="code">g.scale(-1,1)</span> followed by <span class="code">g.translate(-getWidth(),0)</span>.
After the scale, the text lies to the left of the label.  To translate it back onto
the label, it must be moved to the right by <span class="code">getWidth()</span> pixels.  However,
that direction is now the direction of the <b>negative</b> x-axis, so the translation
is actually <span class="code">-getWidth()</span>, with a minus sign to indicate that the motion is
in the negative direction.  (As I said before, it takes a fair amount of study to fully
understand transforms.)</p>
