<h2>News for <a href="index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a></h2>

<ul>
<li><b>May 17, 2012</b> -- Version 6.0.2 is released, with fixes for many small, mostly typographical
errors.  Again, thanks to readers who sent in error reports, especially Mark Christy and
John Ganci, who found many errors.</li>
<li><b>May 17, 2012</b> -- The labs for my latest version of Introductory Programming
are now on line at <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124</a>,
with a number of new labs for this version of the course.  (By the way, labs for older versions of
the course -- such as those from
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/index_f11.html">Fall&nbsp;2011</a>,
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/index_f09.html">Fall&nbsp;2009</a>, and

are still available.)</li>
<li><b>July 25, 2012</b> -- Version 6.0.1 is released.  This is a very minor upgrade,
fixing about 75 typographical errors and 3 small errors in sample program code.  (The
worst error was a reversal of the parameters <i>data</i> and <i>newdata</i> in a call
to <i>System.arraycopy</i>() in Section 7.4.2.)  The printed versions at lulu.com have
not been updated.  Thanks to readers who sent in error reports!</li>
<li><b>July 24, 2012</b> -- Note: The web sites for the two-course
sequence that I teach from this book (<a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124</a>
and <a href="http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225">http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225</a>)
now contain the 2011--2012 version of those courses, including a number of labs that were
new this year.</li>

(without changing the book's version number).</li>
<li><b>June 1, 2011</b> -- Version 6.0 is released.  The sixth edition adds a new
chapter on threads and multiprocessing and some coverage of new features of Java 6
