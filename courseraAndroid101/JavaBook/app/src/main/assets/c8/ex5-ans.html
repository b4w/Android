<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 8.5</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.5:</h3>
<p>This exercise uses the
class <span class="classname">Expr</span>, which was described in
<a href="../c8/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;8.4</a> and which is defined in the source code
file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/Expr.java">Expr.java</a></span>.  For this exercise, you
should write a GUI program that can graph a function, <span class="code">f(x)</span>, whose
definition is entered by the user. The program should have a text-input box
where the user can enter an expression involving the variable <span class="code">x</span>, such
as <span class="code">x^2</span> or <span class="code">sin(x-3)/x</span>. This expression is the definition of
the function. When the user presses return in the text input box, the program
should use the contents of the text input box to construct an object of type
<span class="classname">Expr</span>. If an error is found in the definition, then the program should
display an error message. Otherwise, it should display a graph of the function.
(Note: A <span class="code">JTextField</span> generates an <span class="code">ActionEvent</span> when the user
presses return.)</p>


<p>The program will need a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> for displaying the graph. To keep
things simple, this panel should represent a fixed region in the xy-plane,
defined by <span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span> and
<span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;y&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span>. To draw the graph, compute a
large number of points and connect them with line segments. (This method does
not handle discontinuous functions properly; doing so is very hard, so you
shouldn't try to do it for this exercise.) My program divides the interval
<span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span> into 300 subintervals and uses
the 301 endpoints of these subintervals for drawing the graph. Note that the
function might be undefined at one of these <span class="code">x</span>-values. In that case,
you have to skip that point.</p>


<p>A point on the graph has the form <span class="code">(x,y)</span> where <span class="code">y</span> is
obtained by evaluating the user's expression at the given value of <span class="code">x</span>.
You will have to convert these real numbers to the integer coordinates of the
corresponding pixel on the canvas. The formulas for the conversion are:</p>


<pre>a  =  (int)( (x + 5)/10 * width );
b  =  (int)( (5 - y)/10 * height );</pre>


<p>where <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> are the horizontal and vertical coordinates
of the pixel, and <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span> are the width and height
of the panel.</p>


   


<p>Here is an applet version of my solution to this exercise:</p>

<p align="center">
<applet code="SimpleGrapherApplet.class" width="520" height="400" archive="SimpleGrapher.jar" alt=""></applet></p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>I wrote my solution as a subclass, <span class="classname">SimpleGrapher</span>,
of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that represents
the main panel of the program.  The class includes a <span class="code">main()</span> routine
that makes it possible to run the class as a stand-alone application; <span class="code">main()</span>
just opens a window and sets its content pane to be a <span class="classname">SimpleGrapher</span>.
(To make it possible to run the program as an applet, I also defined a separate
class named <span class="classname">SimpleGrapherApplet</span>, a subclass
of <span class="classname">JApplet</span>, to run the program as an applet, but that
is not required by the exercise.)</p>


<p>My solution uses a nested class, <span class="classname">GraphPanel</span>, for displaying the graph.
This class is defined as a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>. It has an instance
variable, <span class="code">func</span>, of type <span class="classname">Expr</span> that represents the function to
be drawn. If there is no function, then <span class="code">func</span> is null. This is true
when the applet is first started and when the user's input has been found to be
illegal. The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method checks the value of <span class="code">func</span>
to decide what to draw. If <span class="code">func</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, then the paint
method simply draws a message on the panel stating that no function is
available. Otherwise, it draws a pair of axes and the graph of the
function.</p>


<p>The interesting work in class <span class="classname">GraphPanel</span> is done in the
<span class="code">drawFunction()</span> method, which is called by the
<span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. This function draws the graph of the function
for <span class="code">-5 &lt;= x &lt;= 5</span>. This interval on the <span class="code">x</span> axis is
divided into 300 subintervals. Since the length of the interval is 10, the
length of each subinterval is given by <span class="code">dx</span>, where <span class="code">dx</span> is
<span class="code">10.0/300</span>. The <span class="code">x</span> values for the points that I want to plot are
given by <span class="code">-5</span>, <span class="code">-5+dx</span>, <span class="code">-5+2*dx</span>, and so on. Each
<span class="code">x</span>-value is obtained by adding <span class="code">dx</span> to the previous value. For
each <span class="code">x</span> value, the <span class="code">y</span>-value of the point on the graph is
computed as <span class="code">func.value(x)</span>. As the points on the graph are computed,
line segments are drawn to connect pairs of points (unless the <span class="code">y</span>-value
of either point is undefined). An algorithm for the <span class="code">drawFunction()</span>
method is:</p>


<pre>Let dx = 10.0 / 300;
Let x = -5                // Get the first point
Let y = func.value(x)
for i = 1 to 300:
    Let prevx = x         // Save the previous point
    Let prevy = y
    Let x = x + dx        // Get the next point
    Let y = func.value(x)
    if neither y nor prevy is Double.NaN:
       draw a line segment from (prevx,prevy) to (x,y)</pre>


<p>The method for drawing the line segment uses the conversion from real
coordinates to integer pixel coordinates that is given in the exercise. By the
way, more general conversion formulas can be given in the case where <span class="code">x</span>
extends from <span class="code">xmin</span> to <span class="code">xmax</span> and <span class="code">y</span> extends from
<span class="code">ymin</span> to <span class="code">ymax</span>. The general formulas are:</p>


<pre>a  =  (int)( (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) * width );
b  =  (int)( (ymax - y) / (ymax - ymin) * height );</pre>


<p>The formulas for <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> are of slightly different form to
reflect the fact that <span class="code">a</span> increases from 0 to <span class="code">width</span> as
<span class="code">x</span> increases from <span class="code">xmin</span> to <span class="code">xmax</span>, while <span class="code">b</span>
<b>decreases</b> from <span class="code">height</span> to 0 as <span class="code">y</span> increases
from <span class="code">ymin</span> to <span class="code">ymax</span>. You could improve the applet by adding
text input boxes where the user can enter values for <span class="code">xmin</span>,
<span class="code">xmax</span>, <span class="code">ymin</span>, and <span class="code">ymax</span>.</p>


<p>In the main applet class, the <span class="code">init()</span> method lays out the components
in the content pane of the applet with a <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> that has a
vertical gap, to allow some space between the graph and the components that are
above it and below it. The "North" component is a <span class="classname">JLabel</span> that is used
to display messages to the user. The "South" component holds
a <span class="classname">JTextField</span>
where the user enters the definition of the function. Since I wanted to add a
label, "<span class="code">f(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span>", next to the text field, I created a
sub-panel to hold both the label and the text field, and I put the sub-panel
in the "South" position of the main panel.  Finally, the "Center"
component of the main panel is the <span class="classname">GraphPanel</span>
where the graph is drawn. A listener for <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span> 
is registered with the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>. 
When the user presses return in the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>, the listener's
<span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method will be called.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method just has to get the user's input
string from the <span class="code">JTextField</span>. It tries to use this string to construct
an object of type <span class="code">Expr</span>. The constructor throws an
<span class="code">IllegalArgumentException</span> if the string contains an error, so the
constructor is called in a <span class="code">try</span> statement that can catch and handle the
error. If an error occurs, then the error message in the exception object is
displayed in the <span class="code">JLabel</span> at the top of the applet, and the graph is
cleared. If no error occurs, the graph is set to display the user's function,
and the <span class="code">JLabel</span> is set to display the generic message, "Enter a
function and press return." The code for all this is:</p>


<pre>Expr function;  // The user's function.
  
try {
    String def = functionInput.getText();
    function = new Expr(def);
    graph.setFunction(function);
    message.setText(" Enter a function and press return.");
}
catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    graph.clearFunction();
    message.setText(e.getMessage());
}</pre>
   

<p>(After viewing my applet for the first time, I was dissatisfied with the
appearance of the label at the top of the applet. 
There was no space between the text of the label and
the gray background of the component. I decided to fix this by adding an
<span class="classname">EmptyBorder</span> to the label to allow more space around the text where the
white background of the label shows through. I also added borders around the main
panel and around the subpanel that contains the text field.  Borders were covered in
<a href="../c6/s7.html#GUI1.7.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.7.2</a>)</p>

/*
   The SimpleGrapher program can draw graphs of functions input by the
   user.  The user enters the definition of the function in a text
   input box.  When the user presses return, the function is graphed.
   (Unless the definition contains an error.  In that case, an error
   message is displayed.)
   
   The graph is drawn on a canvas which represents the region of the
   (x,y)-plane given by  -5 &lt;= x &lt;= 5  and  -5 &lt;= y &lt;= 5.  Any part of
   the graph that lies outside this region is not shown.  The graph
   is drawn by plotting 301 points and joining them with lines.  This
   does not handle discontinuous functions properly.
   
   This program requires the class Expr,
   which is defined in by a separate file, Expr.java.
   That file contains a full description of the syntax
   of legal function definitions.
   
   This class has a main() routine so that it can be run as an application.
