<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> questions on Chapter 8 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           You should be able to answer these questions after studying that chapter.
           Sample answers to these questions can be found <a href="quiz_answers.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>What does it mean to say
that a program is <i>robust</i>?</p>

</td>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</span></td><td>
<p>Why do programming languages
require that variables be declared before they are used? What does this have to
do with correctness and robustness?</p>

</td>

<p>What is a <i>precondition</i>? Give an example.</p>

</td>

<p>Explain how preconditions
can be used as an aid in writing correct programs.</p>

</td>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</span></td><td>
<p>Java has a predefined class
called <span class="classname">Throwable</span>. What does this class represent? Why does it
exist?</p>

</td>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</span></td><td>
<p>Write a method that
prints out a <span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence starting from a given integer, <span class="code">N</span>.
The starting value should be a parameter to the method. If the parameter is
less than or equal to zero, throw an <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>. If the
number in the sequence becomes too large to be represented as a value of type
<span class="ptype">int</span>, throw an <span class="classname">ArithmeticException</span>.</p>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</span></td><td>
<p>Rewrite the method from the previous question, using <span class="code">assert</span>
statements instead of exceptions to check for errors.  What is the difference between
the two versions of the method when the program is run?</p>

</td>

<p>Some classes of exceptions are <i>checked exceptions</i> that
require <i>mandatory exception handling.</i> Explain what this means.</p>

<p>Consider a subroutine <span class="code">processData()</span> that has the header</p>


<pre>static void processData() throws IOException</pre>


<p>Write a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement that calls this subroutine and prints
an error message if an <span class="classname">IOException</span> occurs.</p>

<p>Why should a subroutine
throw an exception when it encounters an error? Why not just terminate the
program?</p>

<p>Suppose that you have a choice of two algorithms that perform
the same task.  One has average-case run time that is Θ(n<sup>2</sup>) while the run time
of the second algorithm has an average-case run time that is Θ(n*log(n)).  Suppose that
you need to process an input of size n&nbsp;=&nbsp;100.  Which algorithm would
you choose?  Can you be certain that you are choosing the fastest algorithm for the
input that you intend to process.
</p>

<tr class="question">
<td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</span></td><td>
<p>Analyze the run time of the following algorithm.  That is, find a function
f(n) such that the run time of the algorithm is O(f(n)) or, better, Θ(f(n)).
Assume that <span class="code">A</span> is an array of integers, and use the length of the array
as the input size, n.
