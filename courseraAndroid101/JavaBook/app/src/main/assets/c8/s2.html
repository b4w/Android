<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="robustness.2.1">8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Provably Correct Programs</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In some cases, it is possible to <b>prove</b> that a program is
correct. That is, it is possible to demonstrate mathematically that the
sequence of computations represented by the program will always produce the
correct result. Rigorous proof is difficult enough that in practice it can only
be applied to fairly small programs. Furthermore, it depends on the fact that
the "correct result" has been specified correctly and completely. As I've
already pointed out, a program that correctly meets its specification is not
useful if its specification was wrong. Nevertheless, even in everyday
programming, we can apply some of the ideas and techniques that are used in
proving that programs are correct.</p>


<p>The fundamental ideas are <span class="newword">process</span> and
<span class="newword">state</span>. A state consists of all the information
relevant to the execution of a program at a given moment during its execution.
The state includes, for example, the values of all the
variables in the program, the output that has been produced, any input that is
waiting to be read, and a record of the position in the program where the
computer is working. A process is the sequence of states that the computer goes
through as it executes the program. From this point of view, the meaning of a
statement in a program can be expressed in terms of the effect that the
execution of that statement has on the computer's state. As a simple example,
the meaning of the assignment statement "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;7;</span>" is that
after this statement is executed, the value of the variable <span class="code">x</span> will be
7. We can be absolutely sure of this fact, so it is something upon which we can
build part of a mathematical proof.</p>


<p>In fact, it is often possible to look at a program and deduce that some fact
must be true at a given point during the execution of a program. For example,
consider the <span class="code">do</span> loop:</p>


<pre>do {
   TextIO.put("Enter a positive integer: ");
   N = TextIO.getlnInt();
} while (N &lt;= 0);</pre>


<p>After this loop ends, we can be absolutely sure that the value of the
variable <span class="code">N</span> is greater than zero. The loop cannot end until this
condition is satisfied. This fact is part of the meaning of the <span class="code">while</span>
loop. More generally, if a <span class="code">while</span> loop uses the test "<span class="code">while
(<span class="bnf">condition</span>)</span>", then after the loop ends, we can be
sure that the <span class="code"><span class="bnf">condition</span></span> is false. We can then
use this fact to draw further deductions about what happens as the execution of
the program continues. (With a loop, by the way, we also have to worry about
the question of whether the loop will ever end. This is something that has to
be verified separately.)</p>


<p>A fact that can be proven to be true after a given program segment has been
executed is called a <span class="newword">postcondition</span> of that program
segment. Postconditions are known facts upon which we can build further
deductions about the behavior of the program. A postcondition of a program as a
whole is simply a fact that can be proven to be true after the program has
finished executing. A program can be proven to be correct by showing that the
postconditions of the program meet the program's specification.</p>


<p>Consider the following program segment, where all the variables are of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>:</p>


<pre>disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
x = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);</pre>


<p>The quadratic formula (from high-school mathematics) assures us that the
value assigned to <span class="code">x</span> is a solution of the equation <span class="code">A*x<sup>2</sup> +
B*x + C = 0</span>, provided that the value of <span class="code">disc</span> is greater than or equal
to zero and the value of <span class="code">A</span> is not zero. <b>If</b> we can assume or
guarantee that <span class="code">B*B-4*A*C&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</span> and that <span class="code">A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0</span>, then the
fact that <span class="code">x</span> is a solution of the equation becomes a postcondition of
the program segment. We say that the condition, <span class="code">B*B-4*A*C&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</span> is a
<span class="newword">precondition</span> of the program segment. The condition
that <span class="code">A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0</span> is another precondition. A precondition is defined to be a
condition that must be true at a given point in the execution of a program in
order for the program to continue correctly. A precondition is something that
you want to be true. It's something that you have to check or force to be true,
if you want your program to be correct.</p>


<p>We've encountered preconditions and postconditions once before, in <a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.6.1">Subsection&nbsp;4.6.1</a>.
That section introduced preconditions and
postconditions as a way of specifying the contract of a subroutine. As the
terms are being used here, a precondition of a subroutine is just a
precondition of the code that makes up the definition of the subroutine, and
the postcondition of a subroutine is a postcondition of the same code. In this
section, we have generalized these terms to make them more useful in talking
about program correctness.</p>


<p>Let's see how this works by considering a longer program segment:</p>


<pre>do {
   TextIO.putln("Enter A, B, and C.  B*B-4*A*C must be &gt;= 0.");
   TextIO.put("A = ");
   A = TextIO.getlnDouble();
   TextIO.put("B = ");
   B = TextIO.getlnDouble();
   TextIO.put("C = ");
   C = TextIO.getlnDouble();
   if (A == 0 || B*B - 4*A*C &lt; 0)
      TextIO.putln("Your input is illegal.  Try again.");
} while (A == 0 || B*B - 4*A*C &lt; 0);

disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
x = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);</pre>


<p>After the loop ends, we can be sure that <span class="code">B*B-4*A*C&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</span> and that
<span class="code">A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0</span>. The preconditions for the last two lines are fulfilled, so the
postcondition that <span class="code">x</span> is a solution of the equation <span class="code">A*x<sup>2</sup> +
B*x + C = 0</span> is also valid. This program segment correctly and provably computes
a solution to the equation. (Actually, because of problems with representing
numbers on computers, this is not 100% true. The <b>algorithm</b> is correct,
but the <b>program</b> is not a perfect implementation of the algorithm. See
the discussion in <a href="../c8/s1.html#robustness.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;8.1.3</a>.)</p>


<p>Here is another variation, in which the precondition is checked by an
<span class="code">if</span> statement. In the first part of the <span class="code">if</span> statement, where a
solution is computed and printed, we know that the preconditions are fulfilled.
In the other parts, we know that one of the preconditions fails to hold. In any
case, the program is correct.</p>


<pre>TextIO.putln("Enter your values for A, B, and C.");
TextIO.put("A = ");
A = TextIO.getlnDouble();
TextIO.put("B = ");
B = TextIO.getlnDouble();
TextIO.put("C = ");
C = TextIO.getlnDouble();

if (A != 0 &amp;&amp; B*B - 4*A*C &gt;= 0) {
   disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
   x = (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);
   TextIO.putln("A solution of A*X*X + B*X + C = 0 is " + x);
}
else if (A == 0) {
   TextIO.putln("The value of A cannot be zero.");
}
else {
   TextIO.putln("Since B*B - 4*A*C is less than zero, the");
   TextIO.putln("equation A*X*X + B*X + C = 0 has no solution.");
}</pre>


<p>Whenever you write a program, it's a good idea to watch out for
preconditions and think about how your program handles them. Often, a
precondition can offer a clue about how to write the program.</p>


<p>For example, every array reference, such as <span class="code">A[i]</span>, has a
precondition: The index must be within the range of legal indices for the
array. For <span class="code">A[i]</span>, the precondition is that <span class="code">0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i 
&lt;&nbsp;A.length</span>. The computer will check this condition when it evaluates
<span class="code">A[i]</span>, and if the condition is not satisfied, the program will be
terminated. In order to avoid this, you need to make sure that the index has a
legal value. (There is actually another precondition, namely that <span class="code">A</span> is
not <span class="code">null</span>, but let's leave that aside for the moment.) Consider the
following code, which searches for the number <span class="code">x</span> in the array
<span class="code">A</span> and sets the value of <span class="code">i</span> to be the index of
the array element that contains <span class="code">x</span>:</p>


<pre>i = 0;
while (A[i] != x) {
   i++;
}</pre>


<p>As this program segment stands, it has a precondition, namely that
<span class="code">x</span> is actually in the array. If this precondition is satisfied, then
the loop will end when <span class="code">A[i]&nbsp;==&nbsp;x</span>. That is, the value of <span class="code">i</span>
when the loop ends will be the position of <span class="code">x</span> in the array. However, if
<span class="code">x</span> is not in the array, then the value of <span class="code">i</span> will just keep
increasing until it is equal to <span class="code">A.length</span>. At that time, the reference
to <span class="code">A[i]</span> is illegal and the program will be terminated. To avoid this,
we can add a test to make sure that the precondition for referring to
<span class="code">A[i]</span> is satisfied:</p>


<pre>i = 0;
while (<span class="newcode">i &lt; A.length</span> &amp;&amp; A[i] != x) {
   i++;
}</pre>


<p>Now, the loop will definitely end. After it ends, <span class="code">i</span> will satisfy
<b>either</b> <span class="code">i&nbsp;==&nbsp;A.length</span> or <span class="code">A[i]&nbsp;==&nbsp;x</span>. 
An <span class="code">if</span> statement
can be used after the loop to test which of these conditions caused the loop to
end:</p>


<pre>i = 0;
while (i &lt; A.length &amp;&amp; A[i] != x) {
   i++;
}

if (i == A.length)
   System.out.println("x is not in the array");
else
   System.out.println("x is in position " + i);</pre>

<a name="robustness.2.2">8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Robust Handling of Input</a>
</h3>


<p>One place where correctness and robustness are important -- and especially
difficult -- is in the processing of input data, whether that data is typed in
by the user, read from a file, or received over a network. Files and networking
will be covered in <a href="../c11/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>, which will
make essential use of material that will be covered in the <a href="../c8/s3.html">next section</a> 
of this chapter. For now, let's look at an example of processing user input.</p>


<p>Examples in this textbook use my <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class for reading input
from the user. This class has built-in error handling. For example, the
function <span class="code">TextIO.getDouble()</span> is guaranteed to return a legal value of
type <span class="ptype">double</span>. If the user types an illegal value, then
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> will ask the user to re-enter their response; your
program never sees the illegal value.  However, this approach can be
clumsy and unsatisfactory, especially when the user is entering complex data.
In the following example, I'll do my own error-checking.</p>


<p>Sometimes, it's useful to be able to look ahead at what's coming up in the
input without actually reading it. For example, a program might need to know
whether the next item in the input is a number or a word. For this purpose, the
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> class includes the function <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span>. This
function returns a <span class="ptype">char</span> which is the next character in the user's
input, but it does not actually read that character. If the next thing in the
input is an end-of-line, then <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span> returns the new-line
character, <span class="code">'\n'</span>.</p>


<p>Often, what we really need to know is the next <b>non-blank</b>
character in the user's input. Before we can test this, we need to skip past
any spaces (and tabs). Here is a function that does this. It uses
<span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span> to look ahead, and it reads characters until the next
character in the input is either an end-of-line or some non-blank character.
(The function <span class="code">TextIO.getAnyChar()</span> reads and returns the next character
in the user's input, even if that character is a space. By contrast, the more
common <span class="code">TextIO.getChar()</span> would skip any blanks and then read and return
the next non-blank character. We can't use <span class="code">TextIO.getChar()</span> here since
the object is to skip the blanks <b>without</b> reading the next
non-blank character.)</p>


<pre>/**
 * Reads past any blanks and tabs in the input.
 * Postcondition:  The next character in the input is an
 *                 end-of-line or a non-blank character.
 */
static void skipBlanks() {
   char ch;
   ch = TextIO.peek();
   while (ch == ' ' || ch == '\t') {
         // Next character is a space or tab; read it
         // and look at the character that follows it.
      ch = TextIO.getAnyChar();
      ch = TextIO.peek();
   }
} // end skipBlanks()</pre>
   

<p>(In fact, this operation is so common that it is built into the most
recent version of <span class="code">TextIO</span>.  The method <span class="code">TextIO.skipBlanks()</span>
does essentially the same thing as the <span class="code">skipBlanks()</span> method
presented here.)</p>


<p>An example in <a href="../c3/s5.html#control.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;3.5.3</a> allowed the user to
enter length measurements such as "3 miles" or "1 foot". It would then convert
the measurement into inches, feet, yards, and miles. But people commonly use
combined measurements such as "3 feet 7 inches". Let's improve the program so
that it allows inputs of this form.</p>


<p>More specifically, the user will input lines containing one or more
measurements such as "1 foot" or "3 miles 20 yards 2 feet". The legal units of
measure are inch, foot, yard, and mile. The program will also recognize plurals
(inches, feet, yards, miles) and abbreviations (in, ft, yd, mi). Let's write a
subroutine that will read one line of input of this form and compute the
equivalent number of inches. The main program uses the number of inches to
compute the equivalent number of feet, yards, and miles. If there is any error
in the input, the subroutine will print an error message and return the value
<span class="code">-1</span>. The subroutine assumes that the input line is not empty. The main program
tests for this before calling the subroutine and uses an empty line as a signal
for ending the program.</p>


<p>Ignoring the possibility of illegal inputs, a pseudocode algorithm for the
subroutine is</p>


<pre>inches = 0    // This will be the total number of inches
while there is more input on the line:
    read the numerical measurement
    read the units of measure
    add the measurement to inches
return inches</pre>


<p>We can test whether there is more input on the line by checking whether the
next non-blank character is the end-of-line character. But this test has a
precondition: Before we can test the next non-blank character, we have to skip
over any blanks. So, the algorithm becomes</p>


<pre>inches = 0
skipBlanks()
while TextIO.peek() is not '\n':
    read the numerical measurement
    read the unit of measure
    add the measurement to inches
    skipBlanks()
return inches</pre>


<p>Note the call to <span class="code">skipBlanks()</span> at the end of the <span class="code">while</span>
loop. This subroutine must be executed before the computer returns to the test
at the beginning of the loop. More generally, if the test in a <span class="code">while</span>
loop has a precondition, then you have to make sure that this precondition
holds at the <b>end</b> of the while loop, before the computer jumps
back to re-evaluate the test, as well as before the start of the loop.</p>


<p>What about error checking? Before reading the numerical measurement, we have
to make sure that there is really a number there to read. Before reading the
unit of measure, we have to test that there is something there to read. (The
number might have been the last thing on the line. An input such as "3",
without a unit of measure, is not acceptable.) Also, we have to check that the unit of
measure is one of the valid units: inches, feet, yards, or miles. Here is an
algorithm that includes error-checking:</p>


<pre>inches = 0
skipBlanks()

while TextIO.peek() is not '\n':

    if the next character is not a digit:
       report an error and return -1
    Let measurement = TextIO.getDouble();

    skipBlanks()    // Precondition for the next test!!
    if the next character is end-of-line:
       report an error and return -1                   
    Let units = TextIO.getWord()
    
    if the units are inches:
        add measurement to inches
    else if the units are feet:
        add 12*measurement to inches
    else if the units are yards:
        add 36*measurement to inches
    else if the units are miles:
        add 12*5280*measurement to inches
    else
        report an error and return -1
 
    skipBlanks()

return inches</pre>


<p>As you can see, error-testing adds significantly to the complexity of the
algorithm. Yet this is still a fairly simple example, and it doesn't even
handle all the possible errors. For example, if the user enters a numerical
measurement such as <span class="code">1e400</span> that is outside the legal range of values of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, then the program will fall back on the default error-handling
in <span class="classname">TextIO</span>. 
Something even more interesting happens if the measurement is "1e308 miles".
The number <span class="code">1e308</span> is legal, but the corresponding number of inches is outside
the legal range of values for type <span class="ptype">double</span>. As mentioned in the 
<a href="../c8/s1.html#robustness.1.3">previous section</a>, 
the computer will get the value <span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span>
when it does the computation. You might try this in the applet version, below, to see
what kind of output you get.</p>


<p>Here is the subroutine written out in Java:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Reads the user's input measurement from one line of input.
 * Precondition:   The input line is not empty.
 * Postcondition:  If the user's input is legal, the measurement
 *                 is converted to inches and returned.  If the
 *                 input is not legal, the value -1 is returned.
 *                 The end-of-line is NOT read by this routine.
 */
static double readMeasurement() {

   double inches;  // Total number of inches in user's measurement.
   
   double measurement;  // One measurement, 
                        //   such as the 12 in "12 miles"
   String units;        // The units specified for the measurement,
                        //   such as "miles"
